/**
 * The one place a `PrPipelineStatus` becomes words. Every surface that says anything about a PR's state - the
 * list cell, the PR and main-branch headers, the main-branch chip - reads this, so none of them can drift into
 * describing the same state differently.
 *
 * A completed analysis speaks through its checkpoint summary, whose labels come from `derivePresentation` in
 * `@autonoma/checkpoint`. The in-flight and failed phases get a fixed label here: failures are red
 * (`build_failed` / `deploy_failed` for the preview, `analysis_failed` for the run itself) while the in-flight
 * phases stay neutral and are told apart by their label - Building, then Pending checks, then Analyzing - never
 * by color.
 *
 * The two preview failures are separate words because they send the reader to different places. "Build failed"
 * on an app that built in nine seconds and then crashlooped points at the one set of logs that is fine, and
 * that is exactly what it used to say.
 *
 * `none` has nothing to say, so it returns undefined rather than inventing a word for "no signal yet"; the
 * caller decides whether that renders as a dash or as nothing at all.
 *
 * The switch is exhaustive with no `default`, so an eighth kind on the union is a compile error here rather
 * than a silently unlabelled pill.
