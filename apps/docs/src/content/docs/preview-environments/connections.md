title: Connections
description: Wire your apps to the databases, services, and other apps inside a preview with templated env vars that resolve at deploy time.
---

<p class="lead">A connection is an env var whose value is a template resolved against the preview's own topology at deploy time - it's how an app learns the address of the database, cache, or sibling app that lives next to it in the preview.</p>

Every preview is a fresh, isolated stack: your apps, databases, and services come up together in their own namespace, with addresses that don't exist until deploy time. A production `DATABASE_URL` would point at the wrong database, and a hardcoded hostname can't know the preview's namespace. Connections close that gap: you write `{{db.url}}`, and every preview resolves it to that preview's own database.

:::caution[Databases are not auto-wired]
Declaring a Postgres service does **not** inject `DATABASE_URL` into your apps. A service is reachable only by the apps that declare a connection to it. If your app boots but the first query fails with `Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL`, the database is up - your app just has no connection pointing at it.

## Wiring an app to a database

The one-token case covers most apps - `{{db.url}}` expands to the service's full canonical connection string:

![The variable editor in Autonoma with a connection selected. The key is DATABASE_URL, the Source control is set to CONNECTION with the note "wired to a service or app in this preview, resolved at deploy time", and the value field holds the token curly-brace db dot url. Below it a "Fills in at deploy" block spells out what the token becomes - db's connection string](/img/preview-environments/variables-connection.png)

In the dashboard this is the **Connection** source, and the editor resolves each token as you type - so you can see what `{{db.url}}` will become before you deploy, and a name that isn't declared is flagged there rather than at save time.

```yaml
# stack configuration
apps:
    - name: web
      port: 3000
      connections:
          - key: DATABASE_URL
            value: "{{db.url}}"

services:
    - name: db
      recipe: postgres
      version: "16"
```

For a `postgres` service named `db`, the value resolves to `postgresql://preview:preview@<host>:<port>/preview`. Need a different database name, user, or query params? Build the URL by hand from the smaller tokens:

```yaml
connections:
    - key: MONGO_URI
      value: "mongodb://{{db.host}}:{{db.port}}/preview?replicaSet=rs0"
```

## Template reference

A connection value mixes literal text with `{{name.property}}` tokens, where `name` is any app or service declared in the same configuration. A value with no token at all is fine too - use it to pin non-sensitive per-environment config like `NODE_ENV=production`.

| Token | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `{{service.url}}` | The service's full in-cluster connection string: `postgres` -> `postgresql://preview:preview@<host>:<port>/preview`, `mysql` -> `mysql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:3306/<db>`, `redis` / `valkey` -> `redis://<host>:<port>`, `mongodb` -> `mongodb://<host>:<port>/?directConnection=true` |
| `{{service.host}}` / `{{service.port}}` | The service's in-cluster DNS name and port |
| `{{app.url}}` | The app's public HTTPS preview URL |
| `{{app.hostname}}` | The app's public hostname, without the scheme |
| `{{app.host}}` / `{{app.port}}` | The app's in-cluster DNS name and port (app-to-app traffic that shouldn't leave the namespace) |
| `{{pr}}` | The pull request number |
| `{{namespace}}` | The preview's Kubernetes namespace |
| `{{owner}}` | The repository owner |

Services whose recipe has no single canonical scheme (e.g. `temporal`) expose only `host` / `port`.

Referencing a name that isn't declared in the configuration is a validation error at save time, so typos never make it to a deploy.

## Connections vs. secrets

Connections and [secrets](/preview-environments/secrets/) answer different questions:

| | Connection | Secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it holds | A templated or literal, non-sensitive value | A sensitive value (API key, token) |
| Where it lives | In the stack configuration, in your repo's history | Encrypted storage - never in the repo |
| When it resolves | At deploy time, per preview | Uploaded once, mounted as-is |

A connection **wins over** a stored secret with the same key. That makes it the override channel for preview wiring: your team can keep a production-shaped `DATABASE_URL` secret uploaded, and the preview's `{{db.url}}` connection overrides it inside the preview only.

## Build-time connections

Some values must exist while the image builds, not just at runtime - a Vite or Next.js frontend bakes its API URL into the client bundle. Set `build_time: true` and the resolved value is also passed as a Docker build arg:

```yaml
connections:
    - key: VITE_API_URL
      value: "{{api.url}}"
      build_time: true
```

This is the connection counterpart of a [build-time secret](/preview-environments/secrets/#build-time-secrets): use `build_time` on a connection for topology values, and the secret's own build-time flag for sensitive ones.
