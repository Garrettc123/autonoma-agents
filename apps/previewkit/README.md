# Previewkit

Preview environments for pull requests. Deploy any stack to Kubernetes without changing your code.

Previewkit builds container images from your repo and deploys them alongside infrastructure services (Postgres, Redis, etc.) into an isolated Kubernetes namespace, then posts the preview URL back to your PR. GitHub `pull_request` events are received by the autonoma API and forwarded to Previewkit.

## Config source

Previewkit deploys from the Application's **preview config** - a `PreviewkitConfig` row and its topology rows, authored from the Autonoma dashboard (e.g. the PreviewKit onboarding topology builder). The config is latest-only: there is one row per Application, overwritten in place on every save (no revision history), and every deploy and redeploy resolves the current config. An Application with no config opts out: its pull requests are skipped.

The shape below is the config document - the contract the API, the MCP tools and this deploy path all speak. It is stored relationally (one row per app, service, connection, hook, repository and setup task) and composed back into this document on read, so the document is how the config is authored and described, never how it is held.

The document carries the whole topology: every app names the repository it builds from (`apps[].repository`, an `owner/repo` full name - mandatory even for single-repo projects). Any repository other than the Application's own is a **multirepo dependency**: it is cloned for source at the branch the branch convention resolves to, but is not a separate Application. A dependency repo whose branch cannot be resolved (neither the convention branch nor its `fallback_branch` exists) records its apps as `skipped` rows and fails the deploy - previews are all-or-nothing, and an app that can never come up makes the preview unpublishable.

Previews are **all-or-nothing**: a deploy succeeds only when every app in the topology builds and becomes ready. One failed build or one app that never passes readiness fails the whole deploy - the environment is marked `failed`, its workloads are scaled to zero, and the PR comment reports which apps failed. There is no partially-ready state, so a `ready` preview (and anything that consumes one, like an Autonoma review) always means the complete topology is serving.

### Readiness

An app that declares a `port` gets a **TCP readiness probe** on it - no health path to configure, and none to keep correct as the app's routes move. There is deliberately no liveness probe: aimed at someone else's application it cannot tell a slow boot from a broken one, and the restarts it causes look like a preview that never comes up. A socket that accepts is not the same as an app that can serve, so callers tolerate a first request landing early (`withColdStartRetry` in `@autonoma/scenario`).

An app that declares **no** `port` accepts no inbound connections - a worker, poller, or queue consumer that only makes outbound calls. It gets no probe, no `containerPort`, no `PORT` env var, no `EXPOSE` line, no Service, and no Gatekeeper route; it is ready once its container is running. Omitting the port is the whole declaration, so there is no second field that can contradict it. Note the failure this prevents is not cosmetic: a worker that declares a port it never binds can never pass the probe, so its pod stays NotReady, the deploy burns its full 10-minute timeout, and - previews being all-or-nothing - the entire environment fails around a process that was healthy throughout.

## Config document

The preview config is authored from the Autonoma dashboard and stored as a `PreviewkitConfig`. It has the following shape (shown here as YAML for readability):

```yaml
version: 2
domain: preview.example.com
registry: ghcr.io/my-org

apps:
    - name: web
      repository: acme/storefront
      path: ./apps/web
      port: 3000
      connections:
          - key: API_URL
            value: "{{api.url}}"

    - name: api
      repository: acme/backend # a multirepo dependency: any repo other than the Application's own
      path: ./apps/api
      port: 4000
      dockerfile: ./apps/api/Dockerfile
      connections:
          - key: DATABASE_URL
            value: "{{db.url}}"
          - key: REDIS_URL
            value: "{{cache.url}}"
      # API keys and other typed values live in the app's secret bundle, not here.

services:
    - name: db
      recipe: postgres
      version: "16"

    - name: cache
      recipe: redis

hooks:
    post_deploy:
        - app: api
          command: "npx prisma migrate deploy"

# Optional per-repo overrides; the repo set itself is derived from apps[].repository.

    - repo: acme/backend
      fallback_branch: main

# Optional; how a dependency repo's branch is derived from the PR branch.

| `repositories`      | No       | Per-repository overrides: `{ repo, fallback_branch }`. The repo set is derived from `apps[].repository`; an entry here only overrides defaults (`fallback_branch` defaults to `main`). Deploy provenance (`sha`) is stamped here in `resolvedConfig` |
| `branch_convention` | No       | How a dependency repo's branch derives from the PR branch: `same_branch_name` (default), `regex` (`pattern` + `replacement`), or `manual` (always the fallback)      |

**App fields:**

| `name`          | Yes      |         | Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens. Used in K8s resource names and URLs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `repository`    | Yes      |         | The `owner/repo` full name of the GitHub repository this app builds from - mandatory even in single-repo setups. Any value other than the Application's own repo makes the app a multirepo dependency                                                                                                                                          |

| `port`          | No       |         | Port the app listens on. **Omit it for an app that accepts no inbound connections** - a worker, poller, or queue consumer. Every app that declares a port gets a TCP readiness probe on it, which such an app can never pass, so declaring one it does not bind hangs the deploy until the timeout. Required for `primary`, `sdk_implemented`, and any app with a `blueprint`. See [Readiness](#readiness)                    |
| `dockerfile`    | No       |         | Path to a Dockerfile relative to repo root. Prefer a `build` block; this bare field is retained for back-compat and builds via the same BuildKit Dockerfile path                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `build_context` | No       |         | Build context directory for the bare `dockerfile` field. Prefer a `build` block                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `connections`   | No       | `[]`    | Non-secret variables resolved at deploy time. Each is `{ key, value, build_time? }` where `value` is a template mixing literal text and `{{name.property}}` tokens (e.g. `DATABASE_URL` -> `{{db.url}}`). See [Connections](#connections)                                                                                                      |
| `command`       | No       |         | Override the container command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `primary`       | No       |         | Marks this app as the environment's primary URL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `sdk_implemented` | No     |         | Marks the app that serves the Autonoma SDK handler, so scenario up/down is sent to its preview URL. At most one app. Independent of `primary`: a full-stack app sets both, a split front/API topology marks the frontend `primary` and the API `sdk_implemented`. May be declared on a connected repo's app (the merged topology is searched), while the fallback stays this repo's primary app. Unset falls back to the primary app                        |
| `sdk_path`      | No       |         | Path the SDK handler is mounted at on this app, when it is not the conventional `/api/autonoma` - e.g. `/autonoma`. Absolute, no host, no query. Read off whichever app hosts the handler (declared, else the primary), and applied wherever an endpoint is resolved, so changing it takes effect on the next up with no redeploy. Leaving it unset is NOT the same as setting `/api/autonoma`: unset means the config has no opinion, which is what keeps an endpoint registered by hand at another path from being rewritten |
| `depends_on`    | No       |         | Names of apps/services this app waits for before starting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `resources`     | No       | `medium` | **Ignored for user-authored config.** A size is a tier, not a quantity: `small` 150m/256Mi, `standard` 250m/512Mi, `medium` 250m/1Gi, `large` 500m/1Gi, `xlarge` 500m/2Gi. Memory is both the request and the limit; CPU is a request only, so apps still burst freely. Write it as `resources: { tier: "large" }`. A config carrying raw `cpu`/`memory` still parses and snaps UP to the smallest tier covering both, so nothing shrinks. The field is honored only for trusted, platform-authored config. |

**Build block (`build`):**

An app may carry an optional `build` block that selects a build strategy explicitly instead of relying on a bare Dockerfile (see [Building Images](#building-images)). It is a discriminated union on `framework`. Two arms can be **authored**:

- **`dockerfile`** - build a user-authored Dockerfile. Fields: `dockerfile` (required, path relative to repo root) and optional `target` (multi-stage stage to build).
- **`runtime`** - the **raw escape hatch**. You pick a language runtime or bare base image and write the build yourself; the generator emits a trivial `FROM <image>` / toolbelt / `RUN <build_script>` / `CMD <entrypoint>` Dockerfile with no autodetection. Fields:

| Field           | Required | Default                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runtime`       | Yes      |                                  | One of `node`, `python`, `go`, `rust`, `java`, `ruby`, `php`, `cpp`, `debian` (bare base image). Selects the base image (see `packages/types/src/schemas/previewkit-runtimes.ts`)                         |
| `version`       | No       | catalog default (e.g. node `22`) | Image tag, e.g. `"20"`. Constrained to a safe tag charset so it cannot break out of the `FROM` line                                                                                                       |
| `build_script`  | No       |                                  | Bash build step baked into the image as a cached layer. Runs under bash via a heredoc, so multi-line scripts, loops, and conditionals work. Cannot contain a line equal to the reserved heredoc delimiter |
| `entrypoint`    | Yes      |                                  | Bash container start command, baked as a single-line `CMD` (line breaks are rejected). `command` still overrides it at deploy time                                                                        |
| `build_context` | No       | `app`                            | `app` builds from the app directory; `root` builds from the repo root                                                                                                                                     |

Every runtime is a Debian-family (`apt`) image, so the generator installs one common toolbelt (`git`, `curl`, `jq`, `rg`, `make`, `ssh`, ...) plus per-runtime setup (e.g. `corepack` for node, `uv` for python, `composer` for php), and switches the shell to bash. The generated image clones the repo to `/workspace/<app>`.

**Retired framework presets** (`node`, `next`, `vite`, `bun`) generate a single-stage Dockerfile from a node/bun base image, with `package_manager` (`npm` | `pnpm` | `yarn`, default `pnpm`), `node_version` (default `22`, absent for `bun`), `build_context`, and optional `install_command` / `build_command` / `run_command` overrides; with `build_context: root` the build/run commands default to `turbo run build`/`turbo run start` filtered by the app's real workspace `package.json` name (path filter fallback). They are `runtime` with the base image and commands prefilled, and no editor renders one, so they can no longer be **authored**: `previewConfigSchema` still parses them and previewkit still builds them, but `authoringPreviewConfigSchema` - what the config editor and the MCP `apply_config` tools validate against - rejects them. Documents saved before the retirement keep deploying unchanged until someone converts the app to `runtime` (install + build commands into `build_script`, run command into `entrypoint`).

**Blueprint block (`blueprint`) - the additive deploy model:**

As an additive alternative to `build`, an app may set a `blueprint` and let Previewkit supply the build instead of hand-authoring a `build` block. `blueprint` and `build` are mutually exclusive. A blueprint is **either** a preset selection **or** a bring-your-own Dockerfile (the two shapes are mutually exclusive - setting fields from both is rejected):

_Preset mode_ - pick a preset and let Previewkit derive the build/run settings. Presets (`nextjs`, `nuxt`, `sveltekit`, `remix`, `hono`, `express`, `astro`, `vite`, `django`, `fastapi`, `python`, `rails`, `ruby`, `node`, `static`) live in `packages/types/src/schemas/previewkit-presets.ts`.

| `preset` | Yes | | One of the catalog presets; selects the toolchain + default build/run commands and output |
| `version` | No | preset default | Runtime version override (e.g. node `"20"`) |
| `install_command` / `build_command` / `run_command` | No | preset default | Override the derived commands |
| `output_directory` | No | preset default | For static presets: the built directory to serve |
| `build_context` | No | `app` | `root` builds from the repo root for a monorepo (any preset - see below) |

_Dockerfile mode_ - bring your own committed Dockerfile, built as-is (the blueprint counterpart of `build.framework: dockerfile`).

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `dockerfile` | Yes | | Path to the Dockerfile, always relative to the app dir |
| `target` | No | | Stage to build in a multi-stage Dockerfile |
| `build_context` | No | `app` | `root` builds from the repo root (see below) |

**Monorepos.** By default a blueprint builds from the app's own directory, so an app that imports sibling workspace packages sets `build_context: root` to build from the repo root instead. The axis is uniform - it works the same for every preset and for dockerfile mode:
- **Preset + `root`** - commands run in the app directory. Node presets install at the repo root with the package manager detected from the `packageManager` field or lockfile (npm/pnpm/yarn; a bun lockfile falls back to npm) and build through turbo's `--filter` when the repo has a `turbo.json` (topological dependency builds); without turbo, the app's own build script runs in its directory. Python/ruby presets install and build in the app directory - uv/bundler resolve their workspace from a member natively.
- **Dockerfile + `root`** - your workspace-aware Dockerfile builds from the repo root; the `dockerfile` path stays app-relative.

The existing `build`/`framework` model stays fully supported - `blueprint` is a separate, additive path we will migrate to over time. Interim: a preset blueprint is lowered to an equivalent `runtime` build (one path-aware template for app and root contexts alike) and built by the current generator; a dockerfile blueprint is built directly from your file.

| `version`     | No       |         | Image tag (e.g. `"16"` for `postgres:16`)                                                                                          |
| `options`     | No       | `{}`    | Recipe-specific options (e.g. postgres `user` / `database`, `docker-image`'s `image` / `port` / `readiness` / `env`)               |
| `setup_tasks` | No       | `[]`    | Lifecycle commands the service needs (e.g. migrations, seeds). See below.                                                          |
| `resources`   | No       | `standard` | **Ignored for user-authored config** (see app fields). Services have their own ladder, because their profile differs: `small` 100m/256Mi, `standard` 100m/1Gi, `large` 500m/2Gi. |

**Setup tasks** (`setup_tasks[]`) let a database or service run bootstrap commands (migrations, seeds) at deploy time. Each task:

| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `command`   | Yes      | The bash command to run                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `frequency` | Yes      | `on_create` (once when the preview is first created) or `every_commit` (on every deploy)                                                                                                                              |
| `location`  | Yes      | Discriminated on `type`. `{ type: "in_build", app, position }` (`position`: `before` / `after` the named app's build) or `{ type: "separate_job", repo? }` (`repo` is an `owner/repo` full name a topology app builds from; absent = the primary repo) |

**Current behavior:** every setup task runs as a standalone one-off Kubernetes Job between the infra-deploy and app-deploy steps, from the primary app's built image. The `location.type`, `location.position`, and `location.repo` fields are persisted but not yet honored - build-phase ordering and per-repo checkout are on the roadmap.

### Connections

Every variable a user types is a secret (stored in AWS Secrets Manager). The one non-secret variable is a **connection**: an env var whose `value` is a template resolved against the preview's own topology at deploy time. It carries no static secret, so it is never stored in AWS.

Each connection names an env `key` and a `value` template (plus an optional `build_time` flag). The template mixes literal text with `{{name.property}}` tokens, where `name` is an app or service declared in this config:

```yaml
connections:
    # DATABASE_URL = the db service's full connection string
    - key: DATABASE_URL
      value: "{{db.url}}"

    # A hand-built URL combining tokens and literal text
    - key: MONGO_URI
      value: "mongodb://{{db.host}}:{{db.port}}/preview?replicaSet=rs0"

    # A plain literal (no token at all) is fine for non-secret config
    - key: NODE_ENV
      value: "production"

    # VITE_API_URL = the api app's public URL, also baked into the image build
    - key: VITE_API_URL
      value: "{{api.url}}"
      build_time: true
```

Token properties resolve as:

- `host` / `port` - the Kubernetes service DNS name and port within the namespace (e.g. `db`, `api`).
- `url` -
    - an **app**'s public HTTPS preview URL, or
    - a **service**'s in-cluster connection string, when the recipe defines a well-known scheme:
        - `postgres` -> `postgresql://preview:preview@<host>:<port>/preview`
        - `redis` / `valkey` -> `redis://<host>:<port>`
        - `mongodb` -> `mongodb://<host>:<port>/?directConnection=true`
- `hostname` (apps only) - the app's public hostname without the scheme.

Recipes without a single-scheme URL (e.g. `temporal`, `api-gateway`) expose only `host` / `port`.

Three single-word tokens carry deploy context instead of referencing a target: `{{pr}}` (PR number), `{{namespace}}` (the preview's Kubernetes namespace), and `{{owner}}` (repo owner).

Services never auto-inject env into apps - a database is reachable only by the apps that declare a connection to it.

A `build_time` connection is also passed as a Docker build arg (for values baked into the image, e.g. a Vite frontend's API URL). At runtime a connection is injected as an env var and wins over a stored secret of the same key.

### Hooks

Each entry in `hooks.pre_deploy` / `hooks.post_deploy` is `{ app, command }` and runs as a one-off Kubernetes Job built from that app's image, with the app's connections resolved as env. Hooks run in the order they are listed, and their output is relayed to the app's build-log viewer.

The two phases differ in what a failure means:

- **`pre_deploy`** runs before any app Deployment starts (typical use: migrations, so no app boots against a missing schema). A failure is **fatal**: the deploy stops, the environment and every app that had not finished yet are recorded `failed` / `deploy_failed` with the hook's error, and the PR comment + commit status report the failure.
- **`post_deploy`** runs after the apps are up and ready. A failure is **not fatal** - the apps are already serving and these commands are usually idempotent - so the environment stays `ready` and the failure is reported as a warning on the PR comment (with the tail of the hook's output; the full log is in the build-log viewer).

Service `setup_tasks` run just before `pre_deploy` and fail the deploy the same way.

### Built-in Environment Variables

Every app pod is injected with these at deploy time (`Deployer.deployApp`). The names are reserved - the secrets API rejects uploads using them, and they always override any user-set value (a connection or a stored secret):

| Variable                  | Value                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT`     | `true`                                                     |
| `AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT_PR`  | The pull request number (e.g. `123`)                       |
| `AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT_URL` | This app's public URL, `https://{hash}.{domain}` (per-app) |

The reserved key set lives in `@autonoma/types` (`PREVIEWKIT_BUILTIN_ENV_VARS` / `isReservedPreviewkitEnvKey`).

## Secrets Management

Every user-typed variable is a secret. Secrets are stored encrypted in the platform's database, one bundle per (application, app), and are never committed to your repository. At deploy time each bundle is written into a Kubernetes Secret (`{app}-secrets`) in the preview namespace, which the app Deployment mounts via `envFrom`. A secret marked build-time is additionally passed as a Docker build arg; that flag is a column on the secret, not a list on the app.

At deploy time, connections are resolved and injected as pod env, layered on top of the secret bundle. A connection wins over a stored secret of the same key, so it is the override channel for preview-infrastructure wiring while API keys stay in the secret store:

```
Stored secrets (envFrom)  -> { DATABASE_URL: "postgres://prod:5432", OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-..." }
Connections (env, wins)   -> { DATABASE_URL: "{{db.url}}" }
After resolve             -> { DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://preview:preview@db:5432/preview", OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-..." }
```

### API Routes

> **The HTTP API lives in the autonoma API**, under `/v1/previewkit/*`. Previewkit itself is a
> one-shot Kubernetes Job with no HTTP server - the API serves secrets/status natively and launches the
> deploy/teardown/redeploy Jobs that run this code. Point all integrations at the
> autonoma API. Authenticate with an `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` header; keys are scoped to
> your organization.

#### Secrets

Per-app build + runtime secrets, scoped to your organization's applications:

```
GET    /v1/previewkit/secrets/:applicationId/:app          List keys (values never returned)
PUT    /v1/previewkit/secrets/:applicationId/:app          Batch upsert ({"items":[{"key","value"},...]})
PUT    /v1/previewkit/secrets/:applicationId/:app/:key     Save one secret ({"value":"..."})
DELETE /v1/previewkit/secrets/:applicationId/:app/:key     Delete one secret
```

`applicationId` is your autonoma Application id; `app` matches an app `name:` in the preview config.

**Save a secret:**

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.example.com/v1/previewkit/secrets/app_abc123/api/OPENAI_API_KEY \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTONOMA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "sk-..."}'
```

**List secret keys:**

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/previewkit/secrets/app_abc123/api \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTONOMA_API_KEY"
# {"applicationId":"app_abc123","app":"api","keys":[{"key":"OPENAI_API_KEY","maskedLength":8,"updatedAt":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"}]}
```

**Delete a secret:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.example.com/v1/previewkit/secrets/app_abc123/api/STRIPE_KEY \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTONOMA_API_KEY"
```

Each app gets its own bundle - the `api` container never sees `web`'s secrets and vice versa.

#### Webhooks

GitHub `pull_request` events are received by the autonoma API at `POST /v1/github/webhook`, which
launches the deploy/teardown Jobs. Configure your GitHub App's webhook URL there.

GitHub `push` events arrive at the same endpoint: a push to the branch a live main-branch
environment (environment 0) tracks redeploys it at the pushed head, the same way `synchronize`
updates a PR environment. Pushes to any other branch are ignored (and not recorded).

## Environment Variables

Defined and validated in `src/env.ts`, which also extends `@autonoma/logger/env` (`SENTRY_DSN`, `LOG_LEVEL`).

## Preview URL Format

Each app gets an opaque URL whose subdomain is a deterministic hash of the service name, PR number, and repo. This keeps URLs stable across re-deploys while not leaking any of those values in the address.

```
https://{12-char-hex}.{PREVIEW_DOMAIN}
```

For example, PR #42 with apps `web` and `api`:

```
https://a3f8b21c4d9e.preview.example.com
https://7c902ef1ab34.preview.example.com
```

Requires a wildcard DNS record `*.preview.example.com` pointing to your ingress controller.

## Building Images

Previewkit builds each app with BuildKit without a Docker daemon. Every app-build attempt creates an isolated privileged rootful buildkitd Kubernetes Job, connects `buildctl` directly to its ready pod, and deletes the Job when the attempt settles. Each Job's local cache is empty, but every build imports from and exports back to a rolling per-app registry cache (`--import-cache`/`--export-cache type=registry`, one stable tag per app shared across every PR and commit), so a cold Job can still reuse layers a previous build already pushed. The build model is deterministic - every build is a Dockerfile build, and there is no autodetection:

1. **Generated Dockerfile** -- if the app has a `blueprint` (preset mode), or a `build` block with the `runtime` escape hatch (or a retired framework preset -- `node` / `next` / `vite` / `bun` -- from before it was retired), previewkit synthesizes a single-stage Dockerfile and builds it via `buildctl`.
2. **User Dockerfile** -- if the app has a `blueprint` (dockerfile mode) or `build.framework: dockerfile`, or a bare `dockerfile` field, or a `Dockerfile` exists in the app directory, it is built with [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) via `buildctl`. For a multi-stage Dockerfile, set `build.target` (with `build.framework: dockerfile`) to pick the stage to build, like `docker build --target` -- otherwise BuildKit builds the **last** stage, which builds the wrong service when a Dockerfile ends with a worker/sidecar stage after the deployable one.
3. **Neither** -- the deploy fails with an actionable error naming the app. Add a `blueprint`, a `build` block, or a Dockerfile.

All paths push to the configured registry.

**Fetching the source:** every repo a build needs - the app's own and each multirepo dependency - arrives as a GitHub tarball streamed straight through gunzip into tar extraction, never buffered whole. GitHub degrades archive downloads long before it refuses them (roughly half of them dropped mid-body during its 2026-08-17 incident), and a dropped body leaves a half-written tree on disk, so a download that dies is retried up to four times with backoff, each attempt issuing a fresh request into an emptied directory. A response GitHub actually answered - a 404 for an unknown ref, a 403 for a repo the App cannot read - is not retried: it is the answer.

**npm/bun registry mirroring:** when `NPM_REGISTRY_MIRROR` is set, every build - generated or user-authored - gets `npm_config_registry`/`BUN_CONFIG_REGISTRY` `ENV` lines pointing `npm ci`/`pnpm install`/`yarn install`/`bun install` at the in-VPC cache instead of the public registry. For a generated Dockerfile this is baked in by the generator, right before the install step. For a user-authored Dockerfile, previewkit injects it after every stage's `FROM` in a copy it hands to `buildctl` - your checked-in Dockerfile is never modified. Because it's injected right after `FROM`, it's a default: anything your own Dockerfile sets afterward (your own `ENV npm_config_registry=...`, a private `.npmrc`) still wins. Yarn Berry does not honor these variables and needs its own `.yarnrc.yml` override. The cache rewrites the `dist.tarball` URLs in registry metadata to point back at itself, so yarn classic and bun - which fetch exactly the URL the metadata gives them, rather than re-pointing it at the configured registry the way npm and pnpm do - download tarballs through the cache too. A lockfile generated inside a build therefore records mirror URLs in its `resolved` fields.

**Image tag format:** `{registry}/{owner}/{repo}:{app-name}-pr-{N}-{short-sha}` (e.g. `ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo:api-pr-42-a1b2c3d4`)

| Recipe         | Image                                            | Port                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `docker-image` | Configured via `options.image`                   | Configured via `options.port` | Generic recipe for any service; see below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Docker Hub mirroring:** every recipe image that resolves to Docker Hub (including a `docker-image` `options.image` like `minio/minio`) is transparently rewritten to pull through the ECR pull-through cache (`DOCKER_HUB_MIRROR`), avoiding Docker Hub rate limits. Images on other registries (`ghcr.io`, ECR, ...) are pulled directly. Images built from your repo are pushed to and pulled from our own registry and are never rewritten.

### `api-gateway`

An nginx reverse proxy that routes incoming paths to backend services. Each route becomes an nginx `location` block that proxies to its `target` (request-time DNS resolution, so targets that don't exist yet at deploy time still work).

```yaml
services:
    - name: api-gateway
      recipe: api-gateway
      options:
          client_max_body_size: 25m
          inject_headers:
              x-gateway-source: api-gateway-proxy
          routes:
              - path: /graphql
                target: subgraph-core:4001
              - path: /api/
                target: platform-user-service:3000
                strip_prefix: true
```

**`options` fields:**

| Field                  | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `routes`               | Yes      | At least one route. Each: `path` (location prefix), `target` (`host:port`, resolved against the namespace if it has no dot), optional `strip_prefix` (drop `path` before forwarding), optional `rewrite` (custom prefix rewrite)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `client_max_body_size` | No       | nginx `client_max_body_size`. Default `10m`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `inject_headers`       | No       | Map of header -> value added to **every** proxied request via `proxy_set_header`. Since `proxy_set_header` overrides any client-supplied value, this is also how you stamp a trusted gateway-identity header (e.g. `x-gateway-source: api-gateway-proxy`) that upstreams can rely on - clients cannot spoof a header the gateway always overwrites. Header names must be valid HTTP tokens; values cannot contain double quotes or newlines |

Routes are matched most-specific-first (longest `path` wins). The gateway also serves `GET /_health` (200) for its own readiness probe.

### `postgres`

By default the `postgres` recipe runs **Previewkit's own image**, built from
[`postgres.Dockerfile`](src/docker/postgres.Dockerfile), which bundles a broad set of extensions on top of the
standard contrib modules. That image is the source of truth for which extensions are available -
there is no code-side allowlist, so anything baked into it can be requested via `options.extensions`.

The bundled set mirrors what [Neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) ships, minus the
heavyweight builds (plv8, rdkit, pg_duckdb, pg_mooncake, pgrag). Highlights:

- **Search / types:** `vector` (pgvector), `postgis` (+ `postgis_raster`, `postgis_topology`),
  `pgrouting`, `h3` / `h3_postgis`, `hll`, `rum`, `ip4r`, `prefix`, `unit`, `semver`,
  `roaringbitmap`, `pg_uuidv7`, `pgx_ulid`, `pg_hashids`.
- **App / API:** `pg_graphql`, `pg_jsonschema`, `pg_tiktoken`, `pgjwt`, `pg_session_jwt` (JWT-backed
  RLS), plus contrib (`uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `citext`, `hstore`, `pg_trgm`, `ltree`, ...).
- **Ops / time-series:** `timescaledb`, `pg_cron`, `pg_partman`, `pg_repack`, `pg_ivm`, `hypopg`,
  `pg_hint_plan`, `plpgsql_check`, `pgaudit`, `pgauditlogtofile`, `wal2json`, `pgtap`.

Beyond the defaults, `postgres` accepts these `options`:

```yaml
services:
    - name: db
      recipe: postgres
      options:
          databases: [analytics, jobs] # extra databases created alongside the default `preview`
          extensions: [uuid-ossp, pgcrypto, vector, postgis, timescaledb]
          storage: 5Gi # PVC size (default 1Gi)
          image: postgres:17 # optional: pin a specific image (see precedence below)
          ssl: true # optional: serve TLS (default false) - see below
```

**`ssl`** (default `false`): Postgres ships TLS off, but some apps force SSL whenever the DB host is
not `localhost` (a habit from managed Postgres like Neon / RDS / AlloyDB, e.g.
`ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`). Against a plain preview DB those clients fail the TLS handshake
(`ECONNRESET`) before any query runs. Set `ssl: true` to serve a throwaway self-signed cert and turn
`ssl=on`. This only makes TLS _available_ - it never requires it - so plaintext clients are unaffected.
The cert is generated by an init container onto an ephemeral volume each pod start; its content is
irrelevant since such clients connect with `rejectUnauthorized: false` and don't verify it.

`databases` and `extensions` are applied once, at first init, via a mounted init script. Each
extension is created (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ... CASCADE`) in the default `preview` database
and in every extra database. To make a new extension available, install it in
[`postgres.Dockerfile`](src/docker/postgres.Dockerfile).

A few extensions (`timescaledb`, `pg_cron`, `pgaudit`) only load via `shared_preload_libraries`. When
you request one of them on the default image, the recipe sets `shared_preload_libraries` for you - no
extra config needed. This applies to the default image only; a pinned `options.image`/`version` is left
untouched, since preloading a library it doesn't ship would crash startup.

**Image precedence:** `options.image` (if set) wins; otherwise an explicit `version` selects the
matching stock `postgres:{version}` (which carries only the contrib extensions, not the baked ones);
otherwise the default image. An extension requested against an image that doesn't bundle it fails at
init time, so only override `options.image`/`version` when you don't need the baked extensions.

### `docker-image`

Use `docker-image` to deploy any container without writing a dedicated recipe. The image, port, command, and readiness probe are configured via `options`.

```yaml
services:
    - name: sandbar
      recipe: docker-image
      options:
          image: ghcr.io/permify/permify:latest
          port: 3476
          command: ["serve"]
          args: ["--database-engine=memory"]
          readiness:
              tcp: {} # or: http: { path: "/health" }, or: exec: { command: ["..."] }
```

**`options` fields:**

| Field              | Required | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`            | Yes      | Full image reference (e.g. `ghcr.io/org/app:tag`)                         |
| `port`             | No       | Primary container port. Omit for workers / jobs that don't need a Service |
| `command`          | No       | Container `command` (entrypoint override)                                 |
| `args`             | No       | Container `args`                                                          |
| `env`              | No       | Plain environment variables for the container: `[{ key, value }]`         |
| `additional_ports` | No       | Extra named ports exposed by the Service: `[{ name, port }]`              |
| `readiness`        | No       | Exactly one of `http`, `exec`, `tcp`. Omit for instant readiness          |

For `readiness.http` and `readiness.tcp`, the probe port defaults to `options.port` if not set. `readiness` also accepts optional `initial_delay_seconds` and `period_seconds`.

## Kubernetes Resources

Each preview environment gets its own namespace with full isolation:

```
Namespace: {owner}-{repo}-{N}-{hash}
  ├── StatefulSet + Service + PVC        (per infrastructure service)
  ├── Deployment + Service               (per app; no per-app Ingress)
  ├── Role + RoleBinding                 (central-gatekeeper: the central proxy's workload grant)
  └── Labels: previewkit.dev/managed-by, previewkit.dev/pr-number, previewkit.dev/repo,
              gatekeeper.dev/managed (+ gatekeeper.dev/routes & idle-timeout annotations)
```

Routing is owned by the central Gatekeeper in `system` (one wildcard Ingress for
`*.preview.autonoma.app`); it discovers each namespace by the `gatekeeper.dev/managed`
label and routes by the `gatekeeper.dev/routes` annotation, so no per-app Ingress exists.
Namespace annotations also store state (comment ID, last deployed SHA) so the service is stateless.

On PR close, the entire namespace is deleted, cascading to all resources.

When a deploy fails, the namespace is kept (so logs, data, and the next push's redeploy all still
have somewhere to land) but its previewkit-managed workloads are scaled to zero immediately using
the same `gatekeeper.dev/wake-replicas` patch the central Gatekeeper's idle sleep applies - a
failed environment does not hold compute while it waits for a fix. PVCs, Services, and Secrets are
untouched, and a Gatekeeper wake or the next deploy restores the workloads.

## Deploying Previewkit

### Prerequisites

- An EKS cluster with the ingress-nginx controller and a wildcard DNS record `*.{PREVIEW_DOMAIN}` pointing at the shared gateway
- Karpenter (build/preview node pools) and the External Secrets Operator (AWS Secrets Manager integration)
- A `buildkit` namespace with `buildkitd-ephemeral-config` plus the `previewkit-build-manager` RBAC and ingress NetworkPolicy
- A GitHub App with `pull_request` and `push` webhook events enabled, pointed at the autonoma API's `/v1/github/webhook` (`push` keeps main-branch environments current)

### Manifests

Kubernetes manifests live under the repo's `deployment/` directory (applied with `kubectl apply`; there is no kustomization):

- `deployment/apps/previewkit.yaml` -- runner ServiceAccount plus its ExternalSecret.
- `deployment/apps/previewkit-job-launcher.yaml` -- versioned launcher Role plus production's binding for creating runner Jobs in the shared namespace.
- `deployment/apps/previewkit-beta-job-launcher-rbac.yaml` -- beta binding applied only after its compatible API rollout succeeds.
- `deployment/buildkit/buildkit-job-manager.yaml` -- narrowly scoped Job/pod lifecycle RBAC plus the single buildkitd ingress NetworkPolicy used by every environment. The policy admits only PreviewKit `deploy`/`redeploy-app` runner pods from the `previewkit` namespace, on TCP/1234. There is no egress policy here: build pod egress is unrestricted (see the isolation caveats below).
- `deployment/buildkit/buildkitd-ephemeral-config.yaml` -- rootful daemon and registry-mirror configuration mounted by every ephemeral build Job.
- `deployment/buildkit/npm-cache.yaml` -- the nginx `proxy_cache` npm registry mirror `NPM_REGISTRY_MIRROR` points at: one replica per zone, each with its own cache volume, reachable only from build pods.
- `deployment/previewkit/cluster/` -- one-time cluster bootstrap:
    - `config/` -- `namespace.yaml` (the shared `system` + `cronjobs` namespaces), `storage-class.yaml`, `vpc-cni-network-policy.yaml`
    - `secrets-manager/` -- `cluster-secret-store.yaml` + `service-account.yaml` (External Secrets Operator -> AWS Secrets Manager)
    - `karpenter/` -- `nodepool.yaml` (default on-demand pool: NVMe-backed instance types, 4h consolidation) + `nodeclass.yaml` (its EC2NodeClass, RAID0 instance store), `nodepool-warm.yaml` (the static on-demand warm node's own EC2NodeClass + NodePool + ballast Deployment)
    - `ingress/` -- ingress-nginx values and the shared gateway HTTPRoute
    - `gatekeeper/` -- the central Gatekeeper (3-replica leader-elected proxy: sleep/wake + routing for every preview) and its wildcard Ingress, plus `migrate-existing-previews.sh` -- the one-time rollout tool that moves already-running previews off their old per-namespace gatekeepers (dry-run by default; run with `--apply` after applying the manifests, and re-run for stragglers)
    - `logging/` -- `alloy.yaml` (DaemonSet shipping preview pod logs to Loki)
    - `monitoring/` -- `prometheus.yaml` + `opencost.yaml` (per-namespace/per-PR cost attribution; see the file headers for access)
- `deployment/cronjob/preview-environment-reaper.yaml` -- nightly (03:00 UTC) reconciliation of preview environments against the cluster: deletes namespaces older than 7 days (base `*-pr-0` environments excluded) AND writes `torn_down_at` for what it takes, plus for any row whose namespace went some other way. Logic in `@autonoma/k8s/preview-reaper`; `DRY_RUN=true` reports without acting. Replaces the `ns-cleaner` shell CronJob, which deleted namespaces with no database access and so left every reclaimed preview still reading as `ready`

Buildkitd runs as an ephemeral privileged rootful Job created by `src/builder/buildkit-job-manager.ts`, not as a static Deployment. Local validation and Dockerfile resolution finish before the Job is requested, so a dedicated node is not held idle during preparation. Every Job has required hostname anti-affinity against other ephemeral builders, so Karpenter gives it a unique node. Jobs require x86 M-family xlarge instances from generations 6 through 8. Tiered node affinity prioritizes m8, then m7, then m6 when newer capacity is unavailable, while the category, generation, size, and architecture selectors admit every matching variant. The container declares no CPU, memory, or ephemeral-storage requests or limits, so BuildKit can consume the node's allocatable resources. Its emptyDir has no sizeLimit and uses the buildkit EC2NodeClass's 50Gi gp3 root disk, while `deployment/buildkit/buildkitd-ephemeral-config.yaml` keeps reclaimable cache below 35GB to leave node headroom. The ConfigMap scopes rootful daemon configuration to this ephemeral lifecycle, while the buildkit Karpenter NodePool can scale to the configured cluster-wide CPU ceiling. The `previewkit-build-manager` RBAC in `deployment/buildkit/buildkit-job-manager.yaml` lets runner Jobs create, observe, and delete those child Jobs. The same manifest restricts cross-pod access to port 1234; it places no restriction on build egress. Child Jobs mount no Kubernetes ServiceAccount token, receive no Kubernetes service-link environment variables, and have no cache-specific IRSA identity. The buildkit EC2NodeClass also requires IMDSv2 with a one-hop response limit and disables IPv6 metadata access, preventing pods from obtaining the node role. The NodePool permits spot and on-demand capacity; interruption failures are retried with a fresh cold Job. A scheduling timeout is surfaced as a temporary compute-capacity issue. Each Job has an active deadline and TTL as crash cleanup backstops, while the normal path deletes it immediately in `finally`.

Rootful BuildKit requires privileged containers, so the cluster admission policy for the `buildkit` namespace must allow them. Jobs run with BestEffort QoS and no CPU or memory cgroup limits, so a runaway build can exhaust its dedicated node. Required anti-affinity keeps that failure away from sibling builds, but does not provide strict containment from node-level failure. `max-parallelism=4` aligns BuildKit concurrency with the xlarge node's four vCPUs. BuildKit also serves its in-cluster API without mTLS; the NetworkPolicy limits other pods but cannot stop a Dockerfile build step inside the daemon pod from reaching that API. Nothing constrains where a build step connects outbound either: the `buildkit` namespace has no egress NetworkPolicy, so a `RUN` step can reach VPC-private and cluster-internal addresses as well as the public internet. What stops it from reading the node role's credentials is the buildkit EC2NodeClass's IMDSv2 one-hop limit, not a network policy. Treat build inputs as trusted and use stronger isolation before accepting untrusted builds.

### Local Development

Unit tests and type checking need no cluster. Running a real image build requires the same control-cluster resources as production: the `buildkit` namespace, rootful ConfigMap, runner ServiceAccount/RBAC, NetworkPolicy, and a schedulable `pool=buildkit` x86 M-family xlarge node from generation 6, 7, or 8.

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit dev
```

Requires access to a Kubernetes cluster and at least these env vars (see the table above):

```
GITHUB_APP_ID=...
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=...      # base64-encoded PEM
PREVIEW_URL_SECRET=...
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit test                 # unit tests, no Docker
pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit test:integration     # Testcontainers (real Postgres), needs Docker
pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit typecheck
```
