# Previewkit - Agent Context

Per-PR preview environments. Previewkit reacts to GitHub `pull_request` events,
builds container images from the PR's repo, deploys them plus infra services
(Postgres, Redis, ...) into an isolated Kubernetes namespace, and posts the
preview URL back to the PR.

This file is loaded automatically when a session works under `apps/previewkit/`.
It complements:

- the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` (monorepo-wide conventions - ESM, strict TS, no `as`,
  `undefined` over `null`, Sentry logging, Zod-at-boundaries, no em dashes);
- `apps/previewkit/README.md` (the user-facing preview config reference);
- the `ui-conventions` skill (required reading before editing the admin UI in
  `apps/ui/`).

When in doubt, read the source - this doc is a map, not the source of truth.

## End-to-end flow

Previewkit has no long-running process - it runs as a one-shot Kubernetes Job per operation. The
autonoma API owns the public surface, a Temporal orchestrator owns the decision to build, and this
app's `src/runner` executes the Job.

```
GitHub pull_request webhook
  -> apps/api  (PreviewkitTriggerService: preflight + credits)
  -> analysisRunWorkflow (packages/workflow, general task queue; its cloning stages proxy to diffs)
       create the branch snapshot -> run impact analysis (source-only) -> DECIDE whether to build
       -> PreviewkitJobLauncher.launchDeploy() creates a `pk-deploy-*` Job (runs apps/previewkit/src/runner):
            clone repo(s) -> build images -> create namespace {owner}-{repo}-{N}-{hash}
            -> deploy infra services -> hand namespace to the central Gatekeeper
            -> deploy app Deployments + Services
            -> run pre/post-deploy hooks -> set the commit status, then exit
       -> wait for the environment to go ready -> attach the branch deployment
       -> Investigators -> Reporter -> settle the analysis run
```

**The build needs a warrant.** A commit on a branch that has never had a live preview, whose diff affects no
test and authors no new one, is not built at all: impact analysis reads only the repo at the head sha,
so it can be asked BEFORE any container exists. Every other case is warranted - a main-branch environment, an
un-onboarded repo, a redeploy of an already-analyzed head, and any branch that already has a preview
(whose build launches concurrently with analysis, so an established preview URL refreshes with no added
latency). The warrant is decided in the orchestrator workflow, not in this app; the runner behaves identically
however it was launched.

**A warrant is not enough to get a Job.** `launchPreviewBuild` (the general worker) resolves the Application and its
preview config the way `prepare` does, and refuses to create a Job when either is absent. A decline that does happen
writes no row at all, so `previewBuildWorkflow` reads the Job's own terminal state
(`PreviewkitJobLauncher.getDeployJobState`) alongside the environment row - a Job that ended having written nothing
is what tells it no preview is coming. Adding a decline path to `prepare` therefore needs no orchestrator change.

On `pull_request.closed`, `launchTeardown()` creates a `pk-teardown-*` Job that runs
`TeardownPipeline` (namespace delete + commit status). The single Autonoma PR comment is owned by the
analysis run workflow (`kind: "pr"`), not the runner, so teardown leaves it in place - its verdict is the
artifact worth keeping - and only flips the commit status to "torn down". A per-app redeploy
(`PATCH .../apps/:app`) creates a `pk-redeploy-app-*` Job (`rebuild` or `restart`).

Main-branch environments (environment 0, created via `POST /v1/previewkit/applications/:id/0`)
ride the same deploy path: a GitHub `push` webhook to the branch a live environment 0 tracks
redeploys it at the pushed head (`deployMainBranchFromPushWebhook`, action `synchronize`).
Pushes that don't update such an environment are dropped by the webhook handler before they
are even recorded - push fires for every branch of every connected repo.

**Concurrency model:** the per-environment mutex is the `previewkit.dev/env={hash}-{pr}` label on
each Job (`PreviewkitJobLauncher`, `@autonoma/k8s/previewkit-jobs`). Launching a deploy or per-app redeploy first deletes
any in-flight "deploy-family" Job for that env (`previewkit.dev/type in (deploy,redeploy-app)`,
Background propagation), then creates the new one - async newest-wins. The deleted pod gets SIGTERM,
which `src/runner/index.ts` turns into an `AbortController` abort: the build's
`signal.throwIfAborted()` / aborted `buildctl` spawn kills the build and releases its ephemeral
buildkitd Job in seconds, and the
deploy branch writes ONLY the superseded build row (`PreviewkitBuild.status = superseded`), never the
env row - the successor owns it. Teardown ignores SIGTERM and runs its (idempotent) namespace delete
to completion, and the deploy-family supersede never targets a running teardown, so a
close-then-reopen can't leave a half-deleted namespace.

**Abort != failure.** A deploy/redeploy Job pod gets SIGTERM only on a deliberate supersede (a newer
push deleting the in-flight Job), so the runner treats SIGTERM as a supersede - it writes the
superseded build row and exits 0, never stamping a (possibly previously-ready) environment `failed`.
Every _handled_ outcome (ready / build_failed / deploy_failed / superseded / skipped) exits 0; only
an unexpected crash exits non-zero, so the Job's `backoffLimit: 1` retries just genuine pod death
(OOM / eviction) and the idempotent DB upserts make that re-run safe. Internal timeouts
(`BUILD_TIMEOUT_MS`, the readiness budgets) record clean failures before the Job's
`activeDeadlineSeconds` backstop fires.

## Directory map (`src/`)

- `runner/` - the one-shot Kubernetes Job entrypoint. `rolldown.config.ts` bundles it into a single
  self-contained `dist/index.js` (all deps inlined, incl. the Prisma wasm compiler), which the
  multi-stage `Dockerfile` ships without any node_modules; the API launches one Job
  per deploy / teardown / per-app redeploy via `PreviewkitJobLauncher`
  (`@autonoma/k8s/previewkit-jobs`; the diffs worker launches deploys, the API launches teardown +
  per-app redeploy). `index.ts` reads
  the `PREVIEWKIT_JOB_SPEC` payload, builds `PreviewkitServices`, runs once, and exits (SIGTERM =
  supersede for deploy/redeploy-app; ignored during teardown). `run-preview-job.ts` is the
  orchestration (linear pipeline calls + a `signal.aborted` supersede branch); the `redeploy-app`
  mode is `rebuild` (build+deploy one app) or `restart` (re-roll its pods). `job-spec.ts` reads the env var and
  parses it against `previewJobSpecSchema` (`@autonoma/types`), the one definition the launcher writes against
  and this reads; `deps.ts` wires the DB-backed side effects. `memory-span.ts` attaches a
  `takeMemorySnapshot()` (`@autonoma/utils`) to a Sentry span as attributes - `index.ts` wraps the whole
  job in one root span so every phase span nests under it as one connected trace per run, and
  `run-preview-job.ts` wraps each pipeline phase (`build` / `deployEnvironment` / `finalize` / `teardown` /
  `restartApp`) in its own child span, recording memory right before it ends. A phase's memory is
  therefore read off its span in Sentry, not a log line; the last span's reading is the closest available
  evidence for an OOM kill, which gets no chance to log or record anything itself.
- `create-services.ts` - builds `PreviewkitServices` (pipelines + provider) once per process.
- `env.ts` - all env vars (`createEnv`); extends `@autonoma/logger/env`.
- `pipeline/build-circuit-breaker.ts` + `pipeline/prisma-build-circuit-store.ts` - the preview-build
  circuit breaker. Gated in `prepare` (before any namespace or buildkit node), keyed on
  `(organizationId, repoFullName, appName)`: if an app's last `PREVIEWKIT_BUILD_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`
  builds all failed (a leading run of `failed` `PreviewkitAppBuild` rows across every PR of the repo,
  ignoring `superseded` builds), the circuit opens - `prepare` short-circuits with a
  `{ kind: "circuit_open" }` `PreparePreviewResult`, sets a "paused" failure commit status, and the
  runner exits `circuit_open` without building. The gate fails open: any breaker error (a transient DB
  blip) is logged and the build proceeds - a guard must never make a deploy worse than not having it.
  Previews are all-or-nothing, so one hopeless app pauses the whole repo. The
  open/closed decision is DERIVED fresh from build history each call; the `PreviewkitBuildCircuit` row
  persists only what history cannot express: the alert-once bookkeeping (`openedAt`/`alertedAt`), the
  half-open probe marker (`probedAt`), and the manual-reset boundary (`resetAt`, via `resetBuildCircuit`).
  Half-open: once the newest failure is older than `PREVIEWKIT_BUILD_CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN_MS`, ONE push is let
  through as a probe and `probedAt` is stamped; while that probe is in flight (newer than the last
  failure and within a ~1h TTL, since it writes no build row until it finishes) every other push is
  blocked, so a busy repo can't fan out concurrent probes for the same broken app. A failed probe writes
  a fresh failure and re-arms the cooldown; a successful one breaks the streak and closes the circuit.
  On open it fires a one-time
  team alert - a Sentry error-level `PreviewBuildCircuitOpenedError` (wired in `create-services.ts`), so
  a silently-broken customer is found on day one. Ships dormant behind
  `PREVIEWKIT_BUILD_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED` (default off): when off, `evaluate` returns immediately with
  no DB read, so the deploy path is unchanged.
- `pipeline/preview-pipeline.ts` - the deploy steps the runner drives (`prepare` / `build` /
  `deployEnvironment` / `finalize` / `fail` / `restartApp`), per-app build loop (`buildOneApp`),
  final-outcome computation, PR-comment payload. Previews are ALL-OR-NOTHING: `build` throws when
  any app is skipped (unresolvable dependency branch) or any build fails, and `deployEnvironment`
  throws unless every app comes up - a `ready` environment always means 100% of its apps are
  serving, and anything less is a `failed` deploy (which also blocks the diffs trigger and every
  other agent run, since those gate on full readiness). A deploy can die before step 6 writes the per-app
  terminal states (a failed pre-deploy hook or setup task is the common case), so `fail` also calls
  `failInFlightApps` - an app row left `built`/`deploying` under a `failed` environment reads as
  "still building" in every rollup that treats the app rows as the source of truth. `fail` also
  scales the namespace's previewkit-managed workloads to zero (`Deployer.sleepWorkloads`, the same
  wake-replicas merge patch Gatekeeper's idle sleep applies): a failed environment gets no traffic,
  and one that failed before the Gatekeeper handoff is not Gatekeeper-managed, so its infra pods
  would otherwise run until the PR closes. Nothing is deleted - PVCs, Services, Secrets and the
  namespace stay, and a Gatekeeper wake or the next deploy restores the workloads. A failed
  POST-deploy hook stays non-fatal but is returned as a PR-comment warning instead of vanishing
  into Sentry.
- `builder/` - image builds. `builder.ts` (interfaces: `Builder`, `BuildRequest`, `BuildResult`,
  `BuildRuntime`), `buildkit-builder.ts` (`buildctl` dispatch), `buildkit-job-manager.ts` (one
  privileged rootful buildkitd Job per app-build attempt).
- `dockerfile-builder/generate-dockerfile.ts` - synthesizes a single-stage Dockerfile from an app's
  `build` block: the `runtime` escape hatch, or a retired framework preset a pre-retirement document
  still carries (`node`/`next`/`vite`/`bun`).
- `config/` - preview config: `schema.ts` (`previewConfigSchema`), `resolver.ts` (shared upgrade +
  validate), `load-config.ts` (`loadConfig` reads the Application's single `PreviewkitConfig` row and
  its topology rows - latest-only, no revision history - and composes the config document from them
  with `documentFromPreviewkitConfigRows`; the config is the whole topology, every app tagged with
  its `repository` full name), `index.ts` (`createPreviewkitDefaults`).
  The pipeline deploys from that DB config only; an Application with no config row is skipped, and
  every deploy/redeploy resolves the current config (there is no pinning to an older one).
  The document is composed, never stored: the rows are the only representation, so a deploy plans
  from them alone.
- `deployer/` - turns config into K8s objects: `deployer.ts`, `resource-factory.ts`
  (app Deployments/Services + hostnames; routing itself is the central Gatekeeper's, see below),
  `env-injector.ts` (`{{name.host}}` template resolution), `hook-job-runner.ts`, `pod-exec.ts`.
- `db/index.ts` - all DB writes (`record*` functions) + the in-memory `AppBuildOutcome` type. `recordBuildFinished`
  also records each app build's compute (`meterAppBuilds`): since buildkit nodes can't be measured via Prometheus
  (excluded from the cAdvisor scrape, and buildkitd escapes its cgroup to host-root anyway) but every build gets
  its own dedicated node of a known fixed shape, usage is derived from the app build's `durationMs` times that
  shape (`computeAppBuildResourceUsage`, local to this file) and recorded to `PreviewkitAppBuildUsage`, then
  deducted from the org's balance via `@autonoma/billing`'s `deductCreditsForBuildUsage` - floored at the org's
  own `creditFloor` (0 by default) rather than requiring sufficiency, so an already-running build is never
  half-billed. `PreviewkitAppBuildUsage.instanceType`/`capacityType` carry the real EC2 instance Karpenter
  provisioned for that build (e.g. "m7i.xlarge"/"spot"), read off the node's labels by
  `BuildKitJobManager.provision()` (`builder/buildkit-job-manager.ts`) once the build pod is scheduled - the
  node-pool's requirements only bound a range (m-family, gen 6-8, xlarge, spot or on-demand), not which concrete
  instance was actually used. Best-effort: a node-lookup failure never fails the build, it just leaves both
  fields unset.
- `recipes/` - infra service recipes (postgres, redis, valkey, mongodb, upstash, api-gateway, docker-image, aws, temporal).
- `git-provider/` - GitHub provider. The deploy/redeploy/teardown target shapes live in `@autonoma/types`;
  the runner keeps no mirror of them.
- `multirepo/`, `secrets/` - multi-repo deps, secret reads. Primary-URL and SDK-host resolution are NOT here:
  the pipeline calls the shared `resolvePrimaryUrl` / `resolveSdkAppUrl` from `@autonoma/types`, the one rule the
  API reads and the orchestrator's readiness wait both use.
  Multirepo: the dependency repo set is derived from `apps[].repository` (every value that is not the target's
  repo); `resolve-target-branch.ts` + `resolve-dependency-checkout.ts` pick each repo's branch/commit
  (convention, else its `repositories[]` `fallback_branch`), and `enrich-repository-shas.ts` stamps the deployed
  `sha` per repo onto `resolvedConfig`. A repo with no resolvable branch records its apps `skipped` (with the
  reason) and then FAILS the deploy before any image builds - previews are all-or-nothing, so an app that can
  never come up makes the preview unpublishable. Two independent secret read paths:
    - **Build-time values** go through `secrets/build-secret-source.ts` (`forBuild`, the Docker
      build args). Postgres only - there is no AWS fallback here, so a bundle Postgres cannot
      serve fails the deploy rather than building against nothing. Which keys those are is a
      column on the secret row (`build_time`), not a list on the app, so there is no key-picking
      and no way to name a key that has no value. Callers pass a `SecretBundle` and nothing else.
    - **The runtime K8s Secret pods mount** goes through `secrets/runtime-secrets.ts`, which loads
      the Application's rows, collapses rows folding to one Secret target
      (`dedupe-secret-targets.ts`), and hands them to `postgres-secret-materializer.ts`, which
      writes each Secret directly. No ExternalSecret is created for anything: a registered app whose
      Secret cannot be written fails the deploy, because `envFrom` is captured at pod start and an
      unpopulated Secret brings the pod up "ready" against missing credentials.
      `secrets/external-secret-release.ts` is all that survives of the ESO path and it is
      decommissioning, not deploy logic: a namespace deployed before the cutover still has an
      ExternalSecret _owning_ its Secret, and ESO would keep reconciling that from a store nobody
      writes, so taking the target over deletes it with `Orphan` propagation (the default cascade
      would garbage-collect the live preview's Secret with it). For namespaces that will not
      redeploy soon - mainly the long-lived PR-0 (main-branch) environments -
      `deployment/previewkit/cluster/release-external-secrets.sh` sweeps them (dry-run by default,
      needs kubectl on the PREVIEW cluster). This is one-way: nothing hands a Secret back to ESO.
      The runner does NOT start the Autonoma review: `analysisRunWorkflow` launched the build in the first place
      and watches the environment row for readiness itself, so it owns everything downstream. The runner stays
      responsible for build, deploy, environment status writes, and the commit status. The single Autonoma PR
      comment (preview status + analysis) is owned by the analysis run workflow, not the runner.

## The public surface lives in apps/api

The whole `/v1/previewkit/*` HTTP surface is implemented natively in
`apps/api/src/previewkit/previewkit-http.router.ts` (auth at the edge with `requireApiKey`,
per-caller org-scoping). Previewkit itself serves nothing over HTTP.

- **Reads:** environment status (`PreviewkitEnvironmentsService` - DB), live log stream
  (SSE relay reading Grafana Loki via `LokiLogStore` behind the shared `LogStore` seam;
  `?source=build` for build output, `?source=app` for runtime stdout/stderr), secrets CRUD
  (`PreviewkitSecretsService` - Postgres only; see `packages/secrets/README.md`), and `openapi.json`. Secret values are
  kept out of the API request log via a body-log blocklist
  prefix on `/v1/previewkit/secrets`. Loki is a VPC-internal EC2 instance (`PREVIEWKIT_LOKI_URL`
  in the API env; unset -> the stream route 503s): build logs are pushed by the runner's
  `LokiBuildLogSink`, app logs by an Alloy DaemonSet on the preview cluster
  (`deployment/previewkit/cluster/logging/alloy.yaml`) tailing `preview-*` pod logs.
- **Lifecycle ops** (deploy / main-branch `POST /applications/:id/0` / teardown / redeploy
  `PATCH /environments/:owner/:repo/:pr` / per-app redeploy
  `PATCH /environments/:owner/:repo/:pr/apps/:app`):
  preflight + org-scoping in `PreviewkitTriggerService` (`previewkit-trigger.service.ts`, mirrors
  `diffs-trigger.service.ts`), then a deploy starts `analysisRunWorkflow` while teardown / per-app redeploy
  launch their Kubernetes Job directly (PreviewkitJobLauncher, `@autonoma/k8s/previewkit-jobs`). Every native route
  authenticates with an Autonoma API key, which is what scopes the request to an organization; there is no
  service-secret path and therefore no unscoped caller.

The admin "active environments" page reads the DB directly:

- API: `deployments.service.ts` (`listActiveEnvironments`) wired through
  `apps/api/src/routes/admin/admin.router.ts` (`admin.listPreviewkitEnvironments`,
  `admin.redeployPreviewkitEnvironment`).
- UI: `apps/ui/src/routes/_blacklight/_app-shell/admin/previewkit/index.tsx`.

The same admin page can run a manual Environment Factory up/down against a single preview (the "Up"
button per row) to seed a scenario and pull back its credentials/cookies for hands-on failure
reproduction. It is in-memory only (no `ScenarioInstance`/`WebhookCall` rows), implemented in
`apps/api/src/routes/deployments/previewkit-env-factory.service.ts` via the DB-free
`provisionScenarioInstance`/`teardownScenarioInstance` helpers, wired through
`admin.previewkitEnvFactory{Options,Up,Down}`. It resolves the owning Application from the env's
`githubRepositoryId` + org (signing secret + scenarios), targets `<preview origin>` + the path of the
Application's main webhook, and sends the `x-previewkit-bypass` header (decrypted via
`PREVIEWKIT_BYPASS_TOKEN_KEY`) to clear Gatekeeper.

## Build strategies (precedence)

Per app, `PreviewPipeline.resolveBuildInputs` (`pipeline/preview-pipeline.ts`) selects the build inputs,
then `buildkit-builder.ts` `dispatchBuild` runs them.

An app uses ONE of two mutually-exclusive models: the new `blueprint` or the existing `build`/framework
union. A `blueprint` is itself either a **preset** selection or a **dockerfile** (bring-your-own),
mutually exclusive. **`blueprint` takes precedence**: if set, `resolveBuildInputs` lowers it via
`blueprintToBuild` (packages/types) - a preset blueprint becomes a `runtime` Build run through the same
generator below (interim: the current single-stage generator; the uniform-builder migration retargets
it), a dockerfile blueprint becomes a `dockerfile` Build built directly from the file. An additive path
we will migrate to over time. **Monorepos**: any blueprint (preset or dockerfile) may set `build_context:
root` - `resolveBuildInputs` detects the repo facts first (`detectBlueprintFacts`: package manager from the
`packageManager` field/lockfile, turbo presence, repo-relative app path) and builds from the repo root. The
lowering stays a single path-aware `runtime` template: the build script installs at the root for node (and
uses turbo's `--filter` when the repo has turbo) or `cd`s into the app for other toolchains, and the
generator emits a final `WORKDIR` into the app dir so the CMD (and any deploy-time command override) runs
there. Dockerfile paths are always app-relative. The existing strategies are unchanged:

1. **`build` block (preferred)** - the app's `build` is a discriminated union on `framework` (the
   `previewConfigSchema` in `packages/types`):
    - `framework: dockerfile` - use the user's Dockerfile at `build.dockerfile`. Optional `target`
      selects a stage in a multi-stage Dockerfile (buildctl `--opt target=`, like `docker build --target`);
      without it buildkit builds the LAST stage, which silently builds the wrong service when a Dockerfile
      ends with a worker/sidecar stage after the deployable one.
    - `framework: node | next | vite | bun` - RETIRED from authoring; a read/deploy path only, for the
      documents saved before the retirement. `generateDockerfile()` (`dockerfile-builder/`) still
      synthesizes a single-stage Dockerfile from install/build/run defaults + overrides, and
      `build_context: app | root` still sets the context (`root` enables a turbo `--filter` for
      monorepos), so those previews keep building unchanged. Nothing can WRITE one: the two
      authoring surfaces (the dashboard config editor and the MCP `apply_config` tools) validate
      against `authoringPreviewConfigSchema`, which admits only `dockerfile` and `runtime`. Do not
      add a new preset - express it as `runtime`.
    - `framework: runtime` - the manual escape hatch. The user picks a language runtime or the bare Debian
      base image (the `previewkit-runtimes.ts` catalog in `packages/types`) + writes a bash `build_script` +
      `entrypoint`; the generator `FROM`s the runtime image at the chosen `version`, installs the common apt
      toolbelt, runs any per-runtime setup, switches the shell to bash, then `RUN`s the build script (heredoc)
      and `CMD`s the entrypoint. Clones to `/workspace/<app>`. No autodetection - the user owns the result.
      Every runtime is Debian-family (apt); the strategy tables keep the door open for another base OS.
      `dockerfile-builder/` is split by concern: `raw-spec.ts` (the `RawSpec` primitive + the one
      `renderDockerfile`), `framework-lowering.ts` + `runtime-lowering.ts` (both lower a `build` into a
      `RawSpec`), and the `os-toolbelt.ts` (apt) strategy table. The npm/pnpm/yarn/bun strategy table
      lives in `@autonoma/types` (`previewkit-node-pm.ts`, consumed by `previewkit-node-build.ts`'s
      command resolution and the blueprint lowering) next to the schema, because the API's MCP needs the
      same command defaults to express a retired preset as a `runtime` build (`toAuthorableDocument`) -
      one definition of what `framework: next` means, not two. Adding a runtime is a catalog entry;
      adding a package manager or base OS is one strategy entry - never a new branch in the generator.
2. **Bare Dockerfile (no `build` block)** - the app's `dockerfile` field, or a `Dockerfile` on disk at
   the app path, is built through the same BuildKit Dockerfile path (`buildWithBuildctl`). There is no
   autodetection: an app with neither a `build` block nor any Dockerfile fails the deploy with an
   actionable `BuildError` at dispatch. The build model is deterministic - build a Dockerfile (user or
   generated) or error. (Railpack autodetection and the `monorepo: turbo` special-case have both been
   removed.)

Build paths complete local validation and preparation before requesting infrastructure, so
`BuildKitJobManager` provisions a privileged rootful buildkitd Kubernetes Job only once the build
inputs are resolved. The manager waits for its pod to be Scheduled and Ready, verifies
TCP reachability on its pod IP, and then `buildctl` runs against that isolated endpoint. The Job runs
in the control cluster's `buildkit` namespace, one per app-build attempt, and is deleted in the
builder's `finally` block. Each Job/pod is labelled with the deploy identity
(`previewkit.dev/repo`, `previewkit.dev/pr`, `previewkit.dev/app`, `previewkit.dev/namespace`,
plus the random `previewkit.dev/build-id`), so a stuck build pod is findable while it is alive with
e.g. `kubectl -n buildkit get pods -l previewkit.dev/pr=42` - the pod otherwise carries no deploy
context. An active deadline and TTL clean it up if the runner crashes, while
`releaseAll()` retries any cleanup that failed during runner shutdown. A transient retry provisions a
fresh Job instead of reconnecting to a failed daemon. Parallel app builds each receive their own Job,
and the all-settled barrier waits for every sibling cleanup before an abort can finish the runner.
Required hostname anti-affinity gives every ephemeral Job a unique node. Jobs require x86 M-family
xlarge instances from generations 6 through 8. Tiered affinity prioritizes m8, then m7, then m6 when
newer capacity is unavailable, while the category, generation, size, and architecture selectors admit
every matching variant. The container declares no CPU, memory, or ephemeral-storage request or limit,
so it can use the node's allocatable CPU and memory. Its emptyDir has no sizeLimit and uses the buildkit
EC2NodeClass's 50Gi io2 root disk, while each daemon's reclaimable cache target is 35GB to leave node
headroom.
`deployment/buildkit/buildkitd-ephemeral-config.yaml` caps each daemon at `max-parallelism=4`.
The BestEffort Job can exhaust its dedicated node, but required anti-affinity isolates sibling
builds from that failure. The ingress NetworkPolicy restricts other pods, but the
unauthenticated BuildKit endpoint still assumes trusted build inputs because an executor in the same
pod can reach it. Each fresh Job's local `emptyDir` cache is empty, but `buildWithBuildctl` /
`buildWithGeneratedDockerfile` pass `--import-cache` / `--export-cache type=registry,ref=<cacheRef>,mode=max`
against a per-(org, repo, app) rolling tag in the shared preview image repository
(`buildPreviewCacheReference`, `builder/image-reference.ts`) - unlike the image tag, this ref carries
no PR/SHA suffix, so every PR and commit for the same app imports the last build's layers and
re-exports its own, and a brand-new app's first build simply misses (buildctl treats an absent cache
ref as no cache, not an error).
The image exporter (`buildctl --output type=image,...`) requests `compression=zstd` instead of
buildkit's gzip default, so the export's per-layer compression is multi-threaded across the node's
cores rather than pegging one core - the fix for a `runtime` build's single giant install/build
layer otherwise taking minutes to export on 4 vCPUs.
Build logs stream to Grafana Loki via `LokiBuildLogSink` (see env vars below) - there is no S3 log
upload. Every attempt for a (repo, PR) shares one Loki stream (keyed by the stable `namespace`), so
`PreviewPipeline.build` calls `logSink.markStart(namespace)` at the top of each attempt to push a
`kind="start"` boundary; the API-side `LokiLogStore` replays a fresh build-log viewer only from the
latest marker, so a rerun's output overwrites prior attempts in the viewer instead of concatenating
(Loki itself stays append-only).

The app-log stream gets the same treatment for deployments: `PreviewPipeline.deployEnvironment` calls
`logSink.markDeploymentStart(namespace)` (pushed with `source="app"`) as the new app pods roll out, so a
fresh app-log viewer replays forward from the latest deployment and a redeploy's runtime output supersedes
the prior deployment's lines. App lines themselves are still scraped by the Alloy DaemonSet, not pushed by
the sink; the sink writes only the marker. With no marker `LokiLogStore` falls back to tailing the newest
app lines in a recent window.

## Data model (`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`, `Previewkit*`)

- `PreviewkitEnvironment` - one per (repo, PR). Holds `status` (enum `PreviewkitStatus`:
  pending/building/deploying/ready/failed/superseded/torn_down), `phase`, `urls` (JSON appName->URL
  map), `resolvedConfig` (the effective config for the latest deploy; summary/readiness views project it for display - no separate manifest column; each dependency repo's `repositories[]` entry is enriched with the concrete `sha` it was deployed at - the per-dependency deploy provenance multi-repo grounding reads back),
  `bypassToken`, `namespace`, `commentId`. Relations: `appInstances`, `builds`, and `branch`
  (nullable `@unique` FK to the autonoma `Branch` the environment deploys; `onDelete: SetNull`). PR
  environments link to the feature branch, which the API creates eagerly when a `pull_request` webhook reaches
  previewkit; the main-branch env (PR 0) links to the application's main branch. Either way the API threads a
  `branchId` on the deploy event and the runner writes it in `recordEnvironmentCreated`. Null only for repos
  with no onboarded Application. Note: `superseded` is only ever written to `PreviewkitBuild`, never the env
  row (the successor run owns it).
- `PreviewkitAppInstance` - the per-app lifecycle record (one row per `(environment, app)`), source of
  truth for an app's status. Seeded `pending` at moment 0 (`recordAppsPending`, once the merged config names
  the apps) and transitioned through the `PreviewkitAppStatus` enum (`pending` -> `building` -> `built` ->
  `deploying` -> `ready`, or terminal `build_failed` / `deploy_failed` / `skipped`) via `recordAppStates`.
  Carries `status`, `imageTag` (null until built), `error`, `url`, `port`. A built-but-undeployed
  app is therefore a distinct queryable row, not an inferred absence. `recordEnvironmentReady` only owns the
  environment row now (status/urls/deployedAt/bypass token); the per-app rows are written separately. Because
  these rows outrank the environment row in the API's rollups, no failure path may leave one in flight -
  `failInFlightApps` (called from `PreviewPipeline.fail` and the per-app redeploy) gives every unfinished row
  the deploy's error, leaving rows that already recorded a terminal verdict alone.
- `PreviewkitBuild` + `PreviewkitAppBuild` - per-push build + per-app build rows (normalized out
  of a former JSON column). App-build `status` enum is `success | failed` (NOT "ok"). `PreviewkitBuild`
  is `@@unique([environmentId, headSha])` so `recordBuildFinished` upserts idempotently across
  Job retries; a superseded build's row is marked `superseded`.
- `PreviewkitBuildCircuit` - the preview-build circuit breaker state for one `(organizationId,
repoFullName, appName)`. Keyed by (org, repo, app) - not per-environment - because the failures span
  many PRs. The open/closed decision is derived from `PreviewkitAppBuild` history, so this row holds only
  what history cannot: `openedAt`/`alertedAt` (null `openedAt` = closed; the pair dedupes the one-time
  alert per open episode) and `resetAt` (a manual-reset boundary - failures at/before it stop counting).
  Rows are kept, not deleted, on close so `resetAt` survives. No relation back to `Organization` (like
  `SkipRecord`); the gate reads the three key columns and never joins.
- `PreviewkitConfig` - the Application's DB-stored preview config (latest-only; one row per
  Application, overwritten in place on save). This is what the deploy pipeline reads. There is no
  revision history: saving overwrites the row, and every deploy/redeploy resolves the current
  config. The topology is RELATIONAL: `PreviewkitConfigApp` (with `PreviewkitConfigConnection`),
  `PreviewkitConfigService` (with `PreviewkitConfigSetupTask`), `PreviewkitConfigRepository` and
  `PreviewkitConfigHook` children, each ordered by a `position` column, plus the parent's own
  `domain` / `registry` / `branch_convention*` columns. Only the polymorphic build leaves stay JSON
  on their row (`build`, `blueprint`, a service's `options`, a setup task's `location`) - the format
  there churns and nothing queries inside it. Readers compose a v2 document from those rows via
  `documentFromPreviewkitConfigRows` (`@autonoma/types`) and validate it at their own boundary. There
  is no document column: the rows are the only stored form. Every app names its `repository`
  (`owner/repo` full name), multirepo dependency apps included. There is no dependency sidecar: a
  multirepo dependency's apps are rows of this one config, tagged by `repository`.
- `PreviewkitSecret` - one row per secret: an env-var name, its sealed value, and whether the build
  gets it as a build arg (`build_time`). Keyed `(app_id, key)` and cascading from the
  `PreviewkitApp` row. There is NO bundle row - a "bundle" is just the set of rows sharing an app. So
  a bundle exists exactly as long as it holds a key: deleting the last one removes the app from the
  secrets UI's bundle picker, and "registered but empty" is not a representable state. The same
  property applies to `build_time`: it is a column on a value, so a key the build needs but nobody
  has supplied cannot be represented at all.

## Access proxy (`gatekeeper`, cluster mode)

One CENTRAL Gatekeeper (a standalone Go service, separate repo at `~/Code/gatekeeper`) serves every
preview: a 3-replica, leader-elected Deployment in `system`
(`deployment/previewkit/cluster/gatekeeper/`), fronted there by one wildcard Ingress for
`*.preview.autonoma.app`. Previewkit no longer stamps any proxy resources or per-app Ingresses into
preview namespaces - the contract per namespace (deployer `deployInfra` step 7) is:

- a namespaced Role + RoleBinding (`central-gatekeeper`, `buildCentralGatekeeperRole*`) granting the
  central ServiceAccount workload access in THIS namespace only - the ClusterRole deliberately has
  no workload verbs (RBAC can't scope to label selectors, and the proxy handles untrusted HTTP), so
  this stamped grant is the only thing letting Gatekeeper sleep/wake the preview;
- label `gatekeeper.dev/managed=true` opts the namespace into Gatekeeper's discovery (written by
  `NamespaceManager.ensureGatekeeperManagement`, AFTER the RBAC so discovery never races the grant);
- annotation `gatekeeper.dev/routes` carries the host -> `{service, port}` table (per-app HMAC
  hostnames; entries never name a namespace - an annotation routes only into its own);
- annotation `gatekeeper.dev/idle-timeout` (from `GATEKEEPER_IDLE_TIMEOUT`) overrides the central
  install's default per namespace.

Gatekeeper picks up label/annotation changes within milliseconds (informer watch), so redeploys
refresh routes the way re-applying the old ConfigMap did. What it does per namespace is unchanged:
**scale-to-zero** after the idle timeout (every workload matching
`TARGET_SELECTOR=previewkit.dev/managed-by=previewkit`, replica counts saved on the
`gatekeeper.dev/wake-replicas` annotation), **wake + hold** on the next request (in
`gatekeeper.dev/depends-on` dependency order), and per-namespace isolation (one preview sleeping or
waking never affects another). Auth is OFF (`AUTH_TOKEN` unset - previews are public; the
unguessable HMAC hostname is the access control, and Gatekeeper's `/_gatekeeper/routes` debug
endpoint deliberately does not exist without auth so those hostnames cannot be enumerated).

Migrating the EXISTING fleet off the old per-namespace gatekeepers is a one-time operator step, NOT
deploy-path code: `deployment/previewkit/cluster/gatekeeper/migrate-existing-previews.sh` sweeps the
old footprint (gatekeeper Deployment/Service/SA/Role/RoleBinding/ConfigMap, its apiserver-egress
NetworkPolicy, and all per-app Ingresses) per namespace, doing the handoff+cutover+teardown together
because they must be atomic (a namespace labelled for the central gatekeeper while its old one still
runs gets two idle loops on the same workloads - the central one sees no traffic and sleeps it). It
reads routes verbatim from the old `gatekeeper-routes` ConfigMap and is dry-run by default. Run it
promptly after shipping cluster mode and re-run for stragglers; the deployer's own handoff is safe
on its own only for brand-new namespaces (which have no old footprint). Debugging: `kubectl -n
system get pods -l gatekeeper.dev/role=leader` (exactly one leader carries traffic), and bad routes
annotations surface as Warning Events (`kubectl get events -n default --field-selector
reason=InvalidRoutes`).

## Key env vars (`src/env.ts`)

`REGISTRY_URL`, `DOCKER_HUB_MIRROR` (ECR pull-through cache prefix; every platform-managed
image resolving to Docker Hub - the recipe services - is
rewritten through it via `deployer/image-mirror.ts`; the Gatekeeper proxy (public.ecr.aws) and client
app images are never touched;
empty string disables), `NPM_REGISTRY_MIRROR` (npm/bun package-registry cache, e.g. the in-cluster
`npm-cache` nginx Service proxying registry.npmjs.org; unlike `DOCKER_HUB_MIRROR` this covers package-manager
installs run by `RUN` steps, not image pulls - injected as `npm_config_registry`/`BUN_CONFIG_REGISTRY`
`ENV` lines into every generated Dockerfile (`dockerfile-builder/raw-spec.ts`) and, for user-authored
Dockerfiles, after every stage's `FROM` in a rewritten copy `buildctl` reads instead of the original
checkout (`dockerfile-builder/inject-npm-registry.ts` via `BuildKitBuilder`); empty string disables both),
`BUILDKIT_BUILD_NAMESPACE`, `BUILDKIT_IMAGE`, `BUILD_READINESS_TIMEOUT_MS`
(node provisioning), `BUILD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` (daemon startup), `BUILD_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PREVIEW_DOMAIN`,
`PREVIEW_URL_SECRET` (HMAC for hostnames), `INGRESS_NAMESPACE` (the shared edge namespace:
Gateway + ingress-nginx + the central Gatekeeper), `GATEKEEPER_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (written per
namespace as the gatekeeper.dev/idle-timeout annotation; the Gatekeeper image itself is
pinned in `deployment/previewkit/cluster/gatekeeper/`, there is no image env var anymore),
`APP_URL`, `GITHUB_APP_ID`/`GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` (base64 PEM),
`BYPASS_TOKEN_KEY`, and `EKS_*`/`AWS_REGION`.
Previewkit secret VALUES held in Postgres are encrypted with a key generation from the
`previewkit_secret_key` table, unwrapped on demand via KMS by `SecretKeys` (`@autonoma/secrets`).
There is deliberately NO key env var: the runner needs only `kms:Decrypt` on the shared CMK
via `PreviewkitServiceRole`, and a deploy with no secrets never calls KMS at all. Rotation, IAM, the
why environments are isolated by their databases rather than by IAM, and the CMK-deletion
risk are in `packages/secrets/README.md`.
`PREVIEWKIT_SECRETS_CMK` is the CMK that wraps the encryption keys; without it nothing can be
unwrapped, and a deploy that needs secrets fails saying so while one that needs none is unaffected.
It is the only secrets knob the runner has - `PREVIEWKIT_SECRETS_READ` and
`CLUSTER_SECRET_STORE_NAME` are gone, because every read is from the database now. It is not set in
the shared `previewkit-env-file` secret: the launcher injects it per-Job from the launching pod's OWN env
alongside `DATABASE_URL`, because the key it names lives in the database that URL points at - a
runner writing to beta's DB needs beta's CMK, not production's. The platform still installs External
Secrets for its own env-file secrets (`deployment/secrets-manager/`); previewkit no longer uses it.
`PREVIEWKIT_BUILD_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED` (default `false`) gates the preview-build circuit breaker
(see `pipeline/build-circuit-breaker.ts`); off = dormant, no extra DB read. `PREVIEWKIT_BUILD_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`
(default 5) is N consecutive failed builds before an app's circuit opens; `PREVIEWKIT_BUILD_CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN_MS`
(default 6h) is the half-open cooldown after which one probe build is let through.
`PREVIEWKIT_JOB_SPEC` is the per-Job `{mode, event, ...}` payload the launcher sets on each runner Job.
`DATABASE_URL` is set on each runner Job by the launcher (`PreviewkitJobLauncher`,
`@autonoma/k8s/previewkit-jobs`, constructed by both the API and the diffs worker) to the _launching
process's own_ DATABASE_URL - an explicit env var that overrides the production DATABASE_URL
carried by the shared `previewkit-env-file` secret, so a runner writes its environment/build rows to
the DB of the env that launched it (prod -> prod, beta -> beta, alpha -> that alpha env's DB).
`LOKI_URL` (optional) - the build-log tier. When set, the builder tees each output chunk and the
pipeline mirrors phase/status transitions into Grafana Loki (`LokiBuildLogSink` behind the
`BuildLogSink` seam from `@autonoma/logger/build-log-sink`, batched + best-effort); the autonoma
API reads them back over the same `LogStore` seam and relays to clients over SSE. Loki's 31d
retention is the archive - there is no Redis tier or S3 log upload anymore (the per-attempt temp
file on disk is removed after each build attempt). Unset disables build-log publishing entirely.
The runner drains the sink's buffer before it exits.

## Build / test

- `pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit typecheck` - tsc (run after any change).
- `pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit build` - rolldown bundle of the runner into `dist/` (what the
  Dockerfile's builder stage runs). `dist/index.js` boots under plain `node` - no tsx at runtime.
- `pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit test` - unit tests (`vitest.config.ts`, excludes `test/integration/**`). No Docker needed.
- `pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit mint-key` - mints the encryption key that seals previewkit
  secret values, for the database `DATABASE_URL` points at. Needs `PREVIEWKIT_SECRETS_CMK` (the
  alias is `alias/previewkit-secrets`) and `kms:GenerateDataKey` on that CMK. Deliberately does not
  import `src/env.ts`, so it runs without the runner's GitHub credentials.
    - Every environment has its own database and its own keys, so this runs once per environment.
      Point `DATABASE_URL` at the one you mean.
    - It refuses to mint when the database already has a key, because a second key is promoted
      immediately and starts a rotation: new writes seal under it while everything already stored
      still needs the old one until re-encrypted. Pass `--rotate` when that is the intent, or
      `--key-id <id>` to choose the id.
- `pnpm --filter @autonoma/previewkit test:integration` - Testcontainers (real Postgres). Needs Docker running.
    - Integration tests import `src/env.ts`, which (even under `TESTING=true`, which only skips the
      logger env) still requires `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` (base64-encoded PEM) and
      `PREVIEW_URL_SECRET`. `vitest.integration.config.ts` supplies all three - the private key is a
      throwaway minted per run - so the suite needs nothing from a developer's environment.
- DB schema changes: edit `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` -> `pnpm db:migrate` -> `pnpm db:generate`.
  Prisma's generated migration for an enum-value rename is destructive; prefer `ALTER TYPE ... RENAME VALUE`.
- Container sizing is a closed tier ladder, not free-form values: the app/service tiers and default
  tier names live in `packages/types/src/schemas/previewkit-resource-tiers.ts` (`STANDARD_RESOURCES`,
  the composed default, is in `previewkit-config.ts` next to it).

## Gotchas

- ConfigMap-derived env/volumes are captured at pod start: changing a ConfigMap (or a `subPath`
  mount) does NOT reach a running pod - restart/redeploy it. The
  same is true of `envFrom` Secret refs, which is why `RuntimeSecrets` returns only once every
  registered app's Secret is actually written - and fails the deploy when one cannot be - and why
  `buildAppDeployment` stamps that Secret's resourceVersion as the `previewkit.dev/secret-version`
  pod-template annotation so a secret change rolls the pods.
  Without this, a pod can boot "ready" with a missing/stale `AUTONOMA_SHARED_SECRET` and every signed
  SDK call 401s until a manual redeploy.
- App-build status enum is `success`, not `ok`.
- The autonoma API uses `apps/api/src/routes/*.router.ts` + service classes (not the
  `routers/`+`controllers/` layout the root CLAUDE.md describes).
