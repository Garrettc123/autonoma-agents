/**
 * A project map is the very first thing the planner establishes: a partition of the
 * codebase into the frontend app(s) whose pages we test, the backend(s) that own the
 * data we seed, and the directories that are irrelevant to either. Every later step
 * scopes itself to this map instead of re-discovering (and re-scanning) the whole
 * tree - which is what let a large monorepo drown the page/knowledge/audit agents.
 *
 * Deliberately framework-agnostic (see apps/cli CLAUDE.md): a repo may be a single
 * fullstack app (frontend and backend the SAME path), a monorepo with many apps, or a
 * codebase that only ships one half (frontend-only or backend-only). Multiple backends
 * are first-class.
