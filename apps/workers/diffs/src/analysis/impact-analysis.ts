 * The Impact Analysis stage of the merged pipeline.
 *
 * On a main-branch run it first absorbs the merge flow (see {@link runMergeFlow}): the plan edits of the PRs that
 * merged in since the last main run are imported and their deletions propagated, so main grades the diff against
 * the suite those PRs actually left behind rather than re-deriving a pre-fix plan and failing it.
 *
 * Then it reuses the DiffsAgent (the same stateless selection the diffs job ran - diff + current suite, no prior-run
 * history, no carry-forward) to mark affected tests and author brand-new ones. A brand-new test is authored onto the
 * run's OWN snapshot via `addTest`; an affected test needs no suite write at all. Finally it adds the covering tests
 * of the branch's open issues of every kind (see {@link reverifyOpenIssues}), which is what lets a fixed bug - or a
 * closed environment/scenario gap - resolve rather than sit open forever.
 *
 * The result is a target list of `(test, reason, origin)` - merge-imported, new, affected and re-verified tests
 * enter the Investigator fan-out identically, deduplicated by test, and each Investigator starts its own runs.
