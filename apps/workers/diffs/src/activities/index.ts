 * selector clone + LLM call and the classify reasoning loop run for MINUTES inside a single async call and
 * cannot heartbeat internally - so without this, Temporal's heartbeatTimeout (2m on these activities) kills any
 * run longer than two minutes. `heartbeat()` throws outside an activity context (e.g. an eval/test runner), so
 * we stop the timer on the first such failure - a no-op everywhere else.
 *
 * `elapsedMs` lands as `lastHeartbeatDetails` on a timeout event, which is what tells a lost worker (beats stop
 * early) from a live run still waiting on something.
