 * and stage edits onto it via `OpenSnapshot`, which requires `processing`) - the branch's real pending snapshot.
 * Then absorbs the merge flow on a main-branch run and reuses the DiffsAgent to select the tests the diff affects
 * and author brand-new ones, materializing each through the canonical update actions (see `selectImpactTargets`).
 * Persists the selection (findings) and the reasoning (onto the job) and returns only the target COUNT - the
 * fan-out and the Reporter re-read the selection and reasoning from the DB, never through the workflow.
