/**
 * Self-heal for the `test_is_wrong` route: the classifier said the app rendered correctly but the TEST's plan does not
 * match it, and produced a complete revised plan. The Investigator authors that plan onto its OWN test via
 * `OpenSnapshot.revisePlan`, which mints a plan for this test case and repoints its assignment (slug preserved).
 * Row-local by construction - it only touches this `(snapshot, testCase)`'s assignment/plan, so every OTHER test on
 * the snapshot (and concurrent Investigators editing their own tests) is untouched.
 *
 * No run is started here - editing the suite never starts one. The Investigator starts the re-run itself, which
 * resolves the rewritten plan; the test's current scenario is preserved because the new plan pins the same scenario
 * the run used.
 *
 * It also returns `previousPlanId` - the plan the assignment held BEFORE the rewrite - which is what a kept
 * `plan_mismatch` restores so a rewrite that still fails is never promoted.
 *
 * A rewrite is only applied when it can be UNDONE, so it refuses (`prepared: false`) when the slug has no assignment
 * or that assignment pins no plan. Both leave the snapshot untouched for the caller to settle as a kept
 * `plan_mismatch`.
