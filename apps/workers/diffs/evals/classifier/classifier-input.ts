 * The one fact production's live-infra tools all hung on: whether previewkit deployed this run's preview.
 *
 * A case frozen from a preview-integrated run may be graded against a classifier that could see more than this
 * replay can - `run_script` has no frozen form, and a case may carry neither the env-var list nor the log window.
 * That gap is a real property of the case, so it is written down rather than left for a reader to infer from an
 * absent field. Whether the replay closes it is a separate, PER-TOOL question, answered by what the case carries
 * - `previewEnvNames` for env listing, `appLogs` for the log stream, nothing for `run_script`. This single
 * boolean only records what production HAD.
 *
 * It is ONE boolean and not one per tool: production gated every live-infra tool on this single fact, so a
 * per-tool record would carry three values that can never disagree. The per-tool differences are all on the
 * replay side, and live on the frozen data present - not here.

 * therefore freezes the whole padded window over the same stream selector and replay does the filtering locally.
