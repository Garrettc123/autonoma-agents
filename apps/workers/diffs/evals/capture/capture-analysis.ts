TODO: author the LLM-judge rubric here.

The judge sees only the agent's structured output plus this body - never the
codebase or screenshots. Grade qualities the deterministic checks above cannot
express:
  - Was the affected-test reasoning sound, with the right rationale?
  - Is each test authored via create_test a genuinely new, on-topic flow - not
    one already covered by an existing test? Name the closest existing test it
    must not duplicate.
  - Does each created test's coverageJustification soundly explain why those
    existing tests do not already cover it (not a placeholder)?
  - Is each created test's description a specific, falsifiable claim about what
    the feature does (what the user does, what should happen, why it matters) -
    not a restatement of the steps or the coverage justification?
Keep every point additive to the frontmatter, and phrase each as something
checkable from the output alone.
