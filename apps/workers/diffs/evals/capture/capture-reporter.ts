 * Capture a Reporter eval case from a live snapshot.

 * Unlike the Analysis and Classifier captures, this one does NOT reconstruct the agent's input from the DB: the
 * Reporter reasons over the branch's issues, which are mutated in place across snapshots (a carried-forward issue
 * overwrites its own narrative), so a reconstruction weeks later would read the captured run's own answer back into
 * its input. Instead the Reporter serializes its assembled input to S3 at report birth, and capture reads that blob
 * back - the only faithful option, and why the corpus is forward-only (a snapshot whose Reporter ran before the
 * serializer shipped has no blob to capture).
 *
 * The blob carries everything except the git coords (immutable snapshot facts); those are re-resolved from the DB
 * and both SHAs validated fetchable, so a case with a dead SHA is never written. Every referenced screenshot key is
 * probed against S3 before the case is written, so a case whose media has rotated away is refused rather than frozen
 * unrunnable.

TODO: author the LLM-judge rubric here.

The judge sees only the Reporter's structured output plus this body - never the codebase, the screenshots, or the
diff. Groundedness (a real file:line, the right frame) is enforced by the result tool at author time, so do NOT
grade it. Grade what the deterministic checks cannot:
  - Does the report read as the whole PR's cumulative state, not just this snapshot's counts?
  - Are the flows clustered into units a reader recognizes (a feature/journey), with one flow able to hold both
    passing and failing tests?
  - Are the title and headline honest given the derived flow statuses - no win erased, no gap hidden?
  - Is each issue's severity call defensible from its narrative?
Keep every point additive to the frontmatter, and phrase each as something checkable from the output alone.
