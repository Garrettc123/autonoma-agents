The judge sees only the classifier's structured verdict plus this body - never the
codebase, the recording, or the screenshots. Grade what the deterministic checks above
cannot express:
  - Does the stated root cause actually follow from the cited evidence, or is the
    verdict right for the wrong reason?
  - Is expectedBehavior/actualBehavior (or whatHappened) specific about what the app
    did, rather than restating the test steps?
  - For a client_bug: does falsePositiveRisk engage with the strongest case that this
    is intended behavior, or is it filler?
  - For a plan_mismatch: does the revised plan target what the app NOW does, rather
    than deleting the assertion that failed?
Keep every point checkable from the verdict alone, and additive to the frontmatter.
