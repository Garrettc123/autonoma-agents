 * pass before a result exists, but whether THIS finding is the SAME problem as an existing issue (carry it forward)
 * or a genuinely new one (open it) is the model's call alone.
 *
 * - `open` bounds how many brand-new issues this run mints. A recurrence asserts `{ maxCount: 0 }`.
 * - `carryForward` / `resolve` are identifier sets over the EXISTING issue ids each reconciliation targets. A new
 *   problem asserts `carryForward: { exact: [] }`; a recurrence asserts `carryForward: { include: [issueId] }`.
 *   `resolve` closes an issue whose covering test(s) re-ran and passed. An `open` mints a fresh issue with no id
 *   yet, so its side is counted (via `open`), never named here.

 * - `issues` - the open-vs-carry-vs-resolve dedup call (see {@link reporterIssueChecksSchema}). The headline.
 * - `issueDetails` - each asserted issue's kind + severity (see {@link reporterIssueDetailSchema}).
 * - `flows` - flow MEMBERSHIP (see {@link reporterFlowCheckSchema}).
 * - `unknownSlugs` is checked ALWAYS (not a field, see {@link checkUnknownSlugs}): a flow citing a slug outside the
 *   branch map is a hallucination, the one flow correction that is a real error rather than a clustering-quality
 *   signal. The swept + duplicate counts are the quality signals - recorded by the evaluation, never gating,
 *   because nothing rejects a bad partition.
 *
 * The three coverage guarantees and grounding are NOT asserted: each self-heals via a `FixableToolError` before a
 * `ReporterResult` exists, so an assertion on the output would be tautological. Flow status/owner are derived in
 * code, covered by their own test.
