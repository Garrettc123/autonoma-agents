/**
 * Activities run concurrently PER POD, and this queue is memory-bound rather than CPU-bound: every concurrent
 * `scenarioUp` on a v1 app resolves its OWN copy of the scenario recipe (ScenarioRecipeStore.loadRecipePayload
 * does not cache, so activities sharing a scenarioId still each hold a resolved `fixtureJson`; v2 apps provision
 * by name and hold no recipe payload, so they are lighter), on top of the off-heap
 * SDK request buffers. At 10, a snapshot fanning out many singleGenerationWorkflow runs at once drove the pod
 * from a ~500MiB baseline to ~1.0GiB and it was OOMKilled against its 1Gi limit mid-activity. Throughput here
 * comes from replicas, not from per-pod concurrency - KEDA scales this deployment on `general` queue depth up
 * to 100 pods. Raise only alongside the pod's memory limit, or once the recipe payload is shared per process.
