 * Without these a test passes for anyone who has run the app locally and fails in CI, which
 * reads as "your change broke a test" rather than "this test needs a file CI does not have".
 * Values are placeholders and must stay obviously fake: a unit test that behaves differently
 * because of what is in here is reaching for something it should be given explicitly.
