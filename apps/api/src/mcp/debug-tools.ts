export const DEBUG_INSTRUCTIONS = `${AUTONOMA_ELEVATOR_PITCH} When a preview fails to build or deploy, or a test fails because the app is broken, these tools let you read the live evidence and fix the cause in this repo.

Every tool names the app either by repoFullName ("owner/repo") or by applicationId - send one, never both. You almost never need to ask the user for either:
- repoFullName is this repository's GitHub remote. Infer it from the working directory (e.g. run \`git remote get-url origin\` and parse "owner/repo"). Use that directly.
- applicationId is what \`pair\` returns if you are onboarding this app. Prefer it while onboarding: the repository may not be linked yet, and there is usually no pull request, so prNumber 0 (the base environment) is the one to ask about.
- Only if you have neither, call list_apps to see the repos you can debug and ask the user which one.
You do NOT need GitHub access - repoFullName is just how Autonoma identifies your app; the org is inferred from it and you must be a member.

Start with the analysis: call get_analysis(repoFullName, prNumber) to read what Autonoma found on the PR - the run's summary, which tests it selected and why, and every open issue with what should have happened, what did happen, file:line code evidence, and a screenshot/clip of the failing run. That is usually enough to fix the problem. Use the deploy-debug flow below instead when a preview fails to BUILD or DEPLOY (not a test/app bug).

Each issue's kind tells you where its fix lives, so route on it rather than assuming everything is a code change:
${describeIssueKindRouting()}

${FALSE_POSITIVE_GUIDANCE}

${describeRecheckLoop()}

Recommended flow when a PREVIEW fails to build or deploy (for a test or app failure, get_analysis above is the entry point):
1. Call get_deploy_status(repoFullName, prNumber) to see which service is unhealthy and whether it failed at build or at runtime.
2. If a service failed to BUILD: call get_build_logs (start with from="tail" to see the failure; use from="head" for the start of the build). Missing build inputs often show up as a missing env var.
3. If a service BUILT but crashes or errors at RUNTIME: call get_app_logs (from="tail" for the crash, from="head" for startup).
4. Call diagnose_deploy(repoFullName, prNumber) to get all the raw evidence in one call - status, each service's state, the latest build outcome, a rule-based failure classification, the config's env-key surface, and error-shaped logs - plus deterministic findings categorized as a missing env var, a setup problem, or a platform error. Reason over the signals yourself; a "platform error" (autonoma_error) is on Autonoma, so contact support rather than editing your repo.
5. Call get_secret_status(repoFullName) to see the full env-var surface per app: topology connections (with their template values) and the secrets that are set, each flagged with whether the build gets it as well as the running app. Secret VALUES are never returned - only presence and masked length. It lists only what EXISTS: a variable nobody has set has no row, so it cannot report one as missing - diff the list against what your code reads.
6. Apply the fix. Three kinds:
   - A missing secret VALUE (an API key, token, password): call set_secret(repoFullName, prNumber, app, key, value). It stores the value and rebuilds or restarts the service automatically. The value reaches both the build and the running app unless you pass buildTime: false.
   - How ONE existing service is built or wired (build path, Dockerfile, port, topology connections): call edit_previewkit_config(repoFullName, prNumber, app, ...the fields to change). It saves the change and rebuilds the service.
   - The SHAPE of the preview (add or remove an app, add or remove a service like a database or a redis cache): call get_config(repoFullName) to read the full document, edit it, and send it back with apply_config(repoFullName, prNumber, document). It redeploys the environment.
   For anything in your source (code, a committed Dockerfile), edit this repo and push - Autonoma re-runs on the new commit.

7. set_secret, edit_previewkit_config, and apply_config trigger the rebuild/restart asynchronously. Call wait_for_deploy(repoFullName, prNumber, app) to block until it settles, then re-check status/logs. Only outcome "in_progress" means call it again; "idle" means nothing was deploying, so stop rather than polling a deploy that never started.

Configuration is PER APPLICATION, not per pull request. Both config tools write the one document that the base environment and every open pull request deploy from, so a change made while debugging one PR changes main and every other PR as well. Their prNumber argument selects only which environment is rebuilt with the saved document - it does not scope the change, and nothing else does either. Per-environment configuration is a known limitation that may come later. Treat a config edit as a change to the whole project: say so before you make one, and if the user wanted something that applies to their PR alone, tell them it is not possible rather than doing it anyway and calling it local. A secret VALUE is the same - set_secret stores it for the application, not for one PR.

Live vs. forensic surface: get_deploy_status, get_endpoints, and wait_for_deploy read the LIVE environment, which Autonoma tears down after testing - once it is gone they return status: "unavailable". The LOGS (get_build_logs, get_app_logs) are different: they persist ~30 days independent of the live environment. So an "unavailable" deploy status does NOT mean the logs are gone. For a post-mortem of a past deploy ("why did this PR's last preview fail?"), call the log tools directly even when status is unavailable.

Scenario recipes (test data): before a test runs, Autonoma asks your deployed SDK to create the entities that test depends on - a named scenario like "logged-in admin with one open invoice". The recipe is the JSON describing those entities, and it lives on Autonoma, not in your repo, so fixing one takes effect with NO redeploy. When a test fails because the data it needed was missing, wrong, or shaped differently than the test expects, that is a RECIPE problem and this is where you fix it: list_scenarios(repoFullName) -> get_recipe(scenarioId) -> dry_run_scenario(scenarioId, recipe) to try an edit against the live SDK without storing it -> repeat -> pass \`save: true\` on the run that passes. Iterate with the unstored candidate rather than saving each attempt: this app is LIVE, and a saved recipe is what every future run of that scenario uses, so a half-finished edit is a change to production test data. Distinguish this from your SDK handler CODE (a missing factory for a model, a broken insert), which lives in this repo and only changes when the app is rebuilt and redeployed.

Cold starts: previews scale to zero after inactivity, so the FIRST request to a preview URL (from get_endpoints) can return a 503 or time out while the pod wakes - the request itself wakes it. That is warm-up, not a failure: wait a few seconds and retry before concluding the app is down. A genuine crash shows up in get_app_logs; a cold start does not.

Keys: every tool takes repoFullName ("owner/repo") or applicationId - one of the two, not both; the per-PR tools also take prNumber, where 0 means the base environment. The organization is inferred from the application (which you must be a member of the org of), so everything is automatically scoped to it.`;

After you push a PR, Autonoma reviews its preview deploy. If it flagged a problem, use the Autonoma MCP tools to find the cause - get_analysis for the run's issues + evidence (what broke, why, and where the fix lives), and get_deploy_status / diagnose_deploy / get_build_logs / get_app_logs / get_secret_status when a preview fails to build or deploy - fix it (set_secret for a missing secret value, edit_previewkit_config for build/wiring changes, or list_scenarios/get_recipe/dry_run_scenario when a test failed on its seed data rather than on the app), confirm the deploy with wait_for_deploy, then call start_analysis to have Autonoma re-check the PR - before merging. The tools name the app by "owner/repo" (infer it from the git remote; if unsure, call list_apps) or by applicationId.`;
