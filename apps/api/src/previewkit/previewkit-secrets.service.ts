 * secrets directly.
 *
 * Each `(applicationId, appName)` pair addresses one bundle: the `previewkit_secret`
 * rows hanging off that app, one per key, each sealed under the environment's
 * encryption key. There is no bundle row, so a bundle exists exactly as long as it
 * holds a key. The runtime materializer writes those values into the K8s Secret a
 * preview's pods mount on the next deploy.
 *
 * There is no name to derive and no global namespace to collide in. That is what
 * retired the ownership tags and the whole self-heal path this service used to
 * carry: adoption, refusal on a foreign owner, recreate-on-deleted and
 * restore-from-scheduled-deletion were all consequences of AWS Secrets Manager
 * names being one flat space shared by every tenant. A bundle is now identified by
 * a foreign key into the Application that owns it, so none of those states exist.
