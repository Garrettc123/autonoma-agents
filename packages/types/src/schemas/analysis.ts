 *
 * - `no_analysis`: no analysis run exists for this PR (it may predate the pipeline).
 * - `in_progress`: a run is going; nothing to read yet, so poll.
 * - `failed`: the run failed before producing a report. Nothing to fix from analysis.
 * - `complete`: a report landed. `issues` is the branch's CURRENTLY open set (read live, so it can be more current
 *   than the PR comment, which renders once per run), and an empty list beside a `passed` verdict is a clean PR.
