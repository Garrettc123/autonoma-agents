//   stage - which silently builds the wrong service when a Dockerfile ends with

//   language runtime or bare base image and writes a bash `build_script` +
//   `entrypoint`; the generator emits `FROM <image>` / `RUN <build_script>` /
//   `CMD <entrypoint>` with a tiered toolbelt, skipping all autodetection.
// A third group - the node / next / vite / bun framework presets - is RETIRED
// from authoring and survives only so already-stored documents keep parsing and
// deploying; see {@link DEPRECATED_BUILD_FRAMEWORKS}.

// disk at the app path) is built via the same BuildKit Dockerfile path; there is
// no autodetection, and an app with neither a `build` block nor any Dockerfile
// fails the deploy with an actionable error. `build_context: root` builds from
// the repository root so workspace dependencies resolve.
