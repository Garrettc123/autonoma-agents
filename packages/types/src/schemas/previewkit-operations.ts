/**
 * An ordered list of edits to an Application's preview config, applied in one
 * transaction.
 *
 * The list exists for one thing a document cannot say: **rename**. A document
 * shows only the after-state, so an app that arrives under a new name is
 * indistinguishable from a new app, and the server has no choice but to delete the
 * old row - taking its secrets and its build history with it, since both cascade
 * from it. `renameApp` names the row, so the id survives and so does everything
 * hanging off it.
 *
 * `replaceConfig` keeps the whole-document write, because most edits genuinely are
 * "here is the topology I want" and an agent composing one is far more reliable
 * than an agent composing a correct edit list. Ordering is what makes the two work
 * together: renames run first, so the document that follows matches the app by its
 * new name and updates the row in place instead of replacing it.
