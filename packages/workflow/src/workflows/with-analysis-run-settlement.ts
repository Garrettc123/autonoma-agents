 * non-cancellable scope or a cancelled workflow leaves the run dangling in `running` forever. The failure is
 * rethrown after settling only when it is a genuine failure or a Temporal cancellation - a run abandoned mid-flight
 * because its application was deleted/unlinked settles `cancelled` and returns normally, emitting no hard failure.
 *
 * Termination is not covered: Temporal runs no workflow code on terminate, so a run killed that way is closed out
 * by the DB supersede of whichever run replaces it. The proactive cancel on application delete/unlink uses Temporal
 * CANCELLATION for exactly this reason - it runs this settlement, terminate would not.
