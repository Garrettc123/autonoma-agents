/**
 * Behavioral tests for the Investigator's verdict state machine: the self-heal loop, the full taxonomy (a
 * terminal verdict passes through; an exhausted `plan_mismatch` loop resolves to a KEPT `plan_mismatch` and reverts
 * its failed rewrite rather than removing the test; an `invalid_test` REMOVES the test - up front, or after a failed
 * heal), containment (a classify fault is contained as a coverage-plane verdict, never a throw), and what it
 * PERSISTS - one classification per iteration, the superseded one always written before the rewrite it motivates.
 * They run the REAL workflow in the time-skipping test environment with mocked activities, so the assertions are on
 * observable outcomes - the verdicts it files, how many times the test re-ran, the plan-edit it authored, whether it
 * reverted, whether it removed the test, and what it recorded about the generation it ran - not on internal calls.
 * classify + self-heal + revert + delete all resolve on the DIFFS queue (the pipeline is re-homed into the diffs
 * worker); the web run resolves on the WEB queue, and scenario provisioning + generation status on the GENERAL one.
