## Architecture

### Workflows

Workflows define the orchestration logic using Temporal's deterministic workflow engine. They use `proxyActivities` to dispatch work to the correct task queue:

- **web** queue - Playwright-based browser automation activities
- **mobile** queue - Appium-based device automation activities
- **general** queue - Scenario setup/teardown, generation lifecycle, and the preview build lifecycle
- **diffs** queue - The analysis pipeline's stages, which clone the repository

The authoritative analysis workflow has one uncancellable terminal activity, `settleAnalysisRun`. It settles the
snapshot and run state before applying GitHub effects, so a failed or cancelled workflow cannot strand a pending
snapshot or an in-progress merge gate.

One workflow runs that pipeline: `analysisRunWorkflow`, keyed on the branch with a terminate-existing policy so the
newest commit (via `triggerAnalysisRun`) displaces whatever was in flight. A `user_prompt` message instead reaches
the branch through `signalWithStartAnalysisRun` - the same workflow id, but `signalWithStart` rather than
terminate, so a message joins the run already working the branch instead of killing it. After a pass settles, the
workflow **drains**: it re-checks the inbox (`hasPendingAnalysisEvents`) and, if a message or push landed after
this pass claimed its batch, continues-as-new to a successor that claims it; it exits only when the inbox is empty.
A registered `analysisInbox` signal handler plus a nudge-flag loop close the completion-window race (Temporal
invalidates a completion command when a signal is buffered, forcing the re-check on replay). The drain only runs
from a pass that could make progress - one that opened a snapshot, or skipped a genuinely already-analyzed head;
a pass that could open no snapshot at all (nothing to analyze, onboarding incomplete, an unsupportable app) exits
without draining, so it cannot spin forever on an event it can never claim. The head it analyzes is resolved at open time from the source of
truth, not taken from its input: `resolvePreviewTarget` reads the live PR/branch head for a previewkit app (which
the run then builds) or the recorded deployment's sha for a customer-hosted one, and `openAnalysisRun` claims every
pending inbox event in the transaction that opens the snapshot. The `{ headSha, baseSha? }` in its input are only a
fallback for when nothing resolves a head (a pre-field in-flight replay, GitHub unreachable). Who hosts the preview
is a fact about the application, resolved by the run's
first activity, not something a caller passes in:

- **absent** - the CUSTOMER deploys the preview, so its URL already exists when the trigger arrives and the run is
  Impact Analysis -> Investigators -> Reporter -> settle.
- **present** - WE build the preview, so the run owns the build and warrants it on the analysis. Impact Analysis is
  source-only (it clones the head sha and reads the diff), so it runs FIRST and a commit on a branch that has never
  had a preview, whose diff selects no test, skips the build+deploy entirely. Every other case builds
  unconditionally, and there the build starts before the run is opened, so no fallible step sits in front of a
  refresh the customer is owed.

The build itself is `previewBuildWorkflow`, a child keyed per COMMIT: the run decides WHETHER to build, the child
owns HOW. A child cannot terminate a running same-id workflow, so two pushes must never share an id; superseding
stays with the launcher's per-(repo, PR) `previewkit.dev/env` label mutex, and a superseded build is cancelled by
Job name.

Waiting for that build asks two questions, not one. `readPreviewBuildStatus` reports what the environment and
per-commit build rows say, and its `missing` means only "nothing recorded YET" - a runner that DECLINES to deploy
(the repo is not linked to an Application, or it has no preview config) exits 0 having written no row, so `missing`
is equally what "never" looks like. `readPreviewBuildJobState` supplies the other half from the Job object itself,
and the poll reads it FIRST, so a Job that had already ended cannot have written a row in between. The refusals that
are knowable up front are refused by `launchPreviewBuild` before a pod is scheduled at all. What is left for the
30-minute claim timeout is a Job that never reports an end - which is what it was sized for.

Past the selection both are identical, which is why the stages past it live in `workflows/run-analysis-stages.ts`
and the settle-exactly-once contract in `workflows/with-analysis-run-settlement.ts`.

### Workers

Each worker polls its own task queue:

- **Web worker** (`apps/workers/web`) - Web execution activities
- **Mobile worker** (`apps/workers/mobile`) - Mobile execution activities
- **General worker** (`apps/workers/general`) - General activities plus the preview build's, and hosts the build
  workflow. It is the pod that holds RBAC to create previewkit build Jobs.
- **Diffs worker** (`apps/workers/diffs`) - The analysis pipeline's stages; runs one activity at a time because
  each clones a repository

### Activity Types

Activities are defined as typed stubs in `src/activities/`. Workers provide the actual implementations. This allows the workflow package to reference activity signatures without importing heavy engine dependencies.

## Testing

`pnpm test` runs the real workflows against Temporal's time-skipping test server with mocked activities - no database
and no Temporal deployment required.

The workflow bundle is expensive to build (webpack, ~4MB, up to ~75s on a contended CI runner), so `test/global-setup.ts`
builds it **once per run** before any suite starts. A worker that hosts workflows must therefore take the prebuilt
bundle rather than bundle its own:

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection: env.nativeConnection,
    taskQueue: TaskQueue.DIFFS,
    workflowBundle: workflowBundle(), // test/fixtures/workflow-bundle.ts - never `workflowsPath` here
    activities,
});
```

Workers that only host activities need no bundle. Start the environment with `createTimeSkippingTestEnvironment()` (it
pins the test server version and retries a failed download), and tear a suite down with
`teardownTestWorkflowEnvironment({ env, workers, runner })` so a half-finished `beforeAll` cannot bury its own error.

Two more fixtures exist because CI runs these suites on a 4-vCPU runner shared with every other package's tests, where
everything Temporal-related is 30-80x slower than locally:

- **`warmUpWorkflowWorker(execute)`** - end `beforeAll` with it. A new worker only executes its first workflow after it
  starts polling and evaluates the bundle in a fresh VM context, which measured 50-90s on that runner. Landing that on
  whichever test runs first blew the 60s `testTimeout` for that one test while every later test finished in ~2s; the
  hook is where the wait belongs (hence its much larger timeout).
- **`terminateAbandonedExecutions(env, workflowIds)`** - call it from `afterEach` with the ids that test started. A
  `testTimeout` fails the test but does not stop the execution, and a leftover run overlapping the next test both
  interleaves in the mocked activities' script and lets the time-skipping clock jump the live test's activity past its
  heartbeat timeout. Sweeping between tests keeps one slow test's failure to one test.

Mocked activities should resolve their per-test script through `Context.current().info.workflowExecution.workflowId`
(see `investigator.workflow.test.ts`) rather than closing over one shared object, so a late activity from an abandoned
run records into its own harness even if the sweep has not reached it yet.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                | Required | Default          | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`      | No       | `localhost:7233` | Temporal server gRPC address                                      |
| `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`    | No       | `default`        | Temporal namespace                                                |
| `TEMPORAL_METRICS_PORT` | No       | unset            | Port for the SDK's Prometheus exporter. Unset = no exporter bound |

## Worker memory: the workflow cache cap

`createTemporalWorker` sets `maxCachedWorkflows` explicitly, and that is
load-bearing rather than tidiness. Left unset, the SDK derives the cache size
from V8's heap limit and budgets ~1.7MiB per cached workflow. Our workflows cost
roughly 34MiB each, so the derived value over-commits by ~20x (539 on a 2Gi pod).
The cache fills the **workflow thread's** heap - not the pod's cgroup - and the
thread dies with `ERR_WORKER_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, taking the worker process with it.

The derivation scales with the heap, which scales with the pod's memory limit, so
**raising a worker's memory does not fix this**: it raises the ceiling and the
cache grows into it. Only the explicit cap bounds it. Read
`temporal_sticky_cache_size` (exposed via `TEMPORAL_METRICS_PORT`) before changing
the cap; a queue whose workflows are long-lived - one that polls for hours rather
than completing in seconds - keeps far more workflows resident per pod than a
short-lived one and is what makes this bite.
