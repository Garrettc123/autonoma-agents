/**
 * Thrown by `SdkClient` when the customer-deployed Autonoma SDK endpoint returns a non-2xx status. Carries the HTTP
 * `status`, the SDK's contractual error `code` (when the body carried one), and the extracted `detail` as
 * structured fields so callers can branch on them without parsing the message string, and carries the same facts
 * as an `SdkFailure` tag on its `SdkCallError` base for the analysis workflow.
 *
 * The motivating case: a managed (PreviewKit) discover that 401s is our own shared-secret drift, not a customer
 * failure, so the caller self-heals on `err.status === 401` rather than surfacing a hard error.
