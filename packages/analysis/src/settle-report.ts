 * - Liveness: a lock on the snapshot row, which a concurrent settlement's status flip must wait for. A Reporter
 *   that finishes after a newer push superseded its run must not mutate branch-scoped issues on evidence from a
 *   head the PR no longer contains - the caller gets `superseded` and reports the discard.
 * - Idempotency: the report is born exactly once. Its existence proves a previous settlement committed
 *   (everything commits together), so a retry gets `already_settled` instead of duplicating every opened issue.
 *
 * Refuses to settle (throws {@link AnalysisCoverageGapError}) when a queued test has neither a verdict nor a
 * recorded containment - the report would read as a clean run over a test that silently never got judged.
