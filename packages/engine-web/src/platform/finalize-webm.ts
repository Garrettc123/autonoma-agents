/**
 * Remuxes a (finalized) Playwright-recorded WebM into a seekable WebM.
 *
 * Even once the recording is fully written, Playwright's WebM has no Cues (the
 * WebM seek index), so browsers can play it but not scrub it - dragging the
 * scrubber does nothing even when the file is fully buffered, because there is
 * no time -> byte-offset map. Rewriting the container with ffmpeg (`-c copy`, a
 * fast container rewrite with no re-encode) makes the muxer emit a proper
 * duration and Cues, which restores seeking.
 *
 * The input MUST already be finalized on disk (see WebVideoRecorder, which uses
 * video.saveAs() rather than video.path() for exactly this reason); ffmpeg
 * cannot parse a half-written recording.
 *
 * On any failure we fall back to the original recording: a non-seekable video is
 * still far better than failing the run over a finalization step.
