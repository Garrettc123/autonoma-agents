 * always get charged in full and never get half-billed mid-flight. Every org defaults to a floor of 0
 * (today's zero-clamp behavior, unchanged), raised only by a deliberate admin action.
 *
 * Generalizes the floor-at-zero CTE pattern shared by `deductCreditsForLlmProxy`/
 * `deductCreditsForPreviewUsage`: same `FOR UPDATE` lock on `billing_customer`, same
 * `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` idempotency on a deterministic `transactionId`, same proportional
 * `subscription_credit_balance` consumption (which still floors at 0 - only the combined
 * `credit_balance` gets the org's configurable floor). `fkColumn` is one of a small, code-controlled
 * set of column names, safe to splice as a raw identifier since it's never user input.
 *
 * A successful deduction also runs the org's auto top-up check. That lives here, on the shared
 * primitive, rather than at each call site so that a new consumption path gets it by construction:
 * the two newest paths (AI cost, previewkit build usage) call this function directly instead of
 * going through `CreditsService`, and would otherwise let an org with auto top-up enabled drain
 * past its threshold to its floor without ever recharging.
