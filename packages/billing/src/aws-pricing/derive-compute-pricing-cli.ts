/**
 * Prints the USD-per-hour compute rates derived from live AWS pricing, for a human to review
 * before applying to `BillingPricing.usdPerVcpuHourMicros`/`usdPerGbHourMicros` - this never
 * writes to the database itself. Run with `tsx src/aws-pricing/derive-compute-pricing-cli.ts
 * [creditsPerUsd]`; the optional `creditsPerUsd` only adds an informational credits equivalent,
 * since prices are stored and applied in USD.
 *
 * These are COST. The stored price carries a margin on top (a fleet default of 1.5x - see the
 * activation migration 20260827120100), so a rate applied straight from this output would resell
 * compute at exactly what it cost us.
 *
 * For a spot-eligible pool (currently just buildkit - see `ComputePoolReference.supportsSpot`),
 * the printed rate is blended by the real spot/on-demand mix buildkit actually got over the
 * last 14 days (see `resolveComputeRates`), not a pure on-demand assumption - on-demand alone
 * systematically overstates real cost whenever spot capacity was available.
 *
 * Caveats worth reading before applying a suggested rate:
 * - Previewkit's rate prices the deployed preview app pods (amd64, no dedicated Karpenter pool
 *   or fixed instance shape - see `REFERENCE_COMPUTE_POOLS`), so it's representative of one
 *   reference instance, not an exact average of everything the cluster might actually schedule.
 * - `BillingPricing` has one shared price pair per org, used for both build and running usage,
 *   even though buildkit and previewkit are priced from different reference instances and
 *   buildkit's is spot-blended - picking one price for both is an approximation either way.
