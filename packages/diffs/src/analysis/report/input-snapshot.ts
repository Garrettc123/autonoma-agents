/**
 * The frozen, on-disk projection of a {@link ReporterInput}, minus its live-only fields: the cloned `codebase`
 * (rehydrated from git coords by the eval) and the two loaders (`screenshotLoader`, `scenarioLoader`), whose data
 * is frozen instead. Screenshots keep their `s3Key`, rehydrated to bytes at run time; the scenario loader's whole
 * resolved output is frozen into `scenarioRecipes`, so `read_scenario` replays as a pure lookup with no DB.
 *
 * It COMPOSES the DTO schemas from `./types` (which infer the runtime interfaces) rather than re-declaring them, so
 * a field added to a nested DTO flows into both the type and this frozen schema from one edit - it cannot silently
 * drift out of a captured case. The only payload-specific top-level shape is `range`, `appSlug` and the
 * `scenarioRecipes` array that stands in for the live `scenarioLoader`.
 *
 * Written by production at report birth and read back by capture, so a case is exactly what the Reporter saw -
 * never a reconstruction. Reconstructing the branch's mutable issues would leak the run's own answer (a carried-
 * forward issue is overwritten in place) into its input, and grade the agent on reproducing it.
 *
 * The git coords are NOT frozen here: they are immutable facts a capture re-resolves from the snapshot, so this
 * payload carries only the mutable, un-reconstructable content. The eval's case schema extends this with coords.
