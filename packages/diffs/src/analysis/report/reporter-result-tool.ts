 * caller gets can never surface an image the agent did not fetch or a code reference that is not really there.

 * author its own status could promote a flow with a failed check to "verified" - the one thing this stage cannot be
 * allowed to do. Unlike the coverage guarantees, a bad PARTITION is corrected rather than rejected: it costs a good
