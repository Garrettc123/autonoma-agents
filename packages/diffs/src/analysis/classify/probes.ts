    'This recording has been COMPRESSED: it was resampled and every stretch where the screen did not change was collapsed, so each frame is a DISTINCT state of the app and consecutive frames may be far apart in real time. Two consequences. (1) Do NOT treat a screen that appears only briefly as a glitch or a sampling artifact - it genuinely occurred, and every frame is worth accounting for. (2) The video\'s own timing is MEANINGLESS as run time: never report a timestamp, a duration, or how long something was on screen. When you need to say WHEN something happened, say it in terms of what came before it ("after the login form was submitted", "on the screen following the search"). Watch from the first frame to the last before answering.';

For EACH occurrence, give:
- the EXACT visible text (quote it), and
- roughly when in the run it appeared (e.g. "after the 2nd message was sent") and on which screen.

- Every DIVERGENCE: a different action than the step described, an unexpected screen or route, a step skipped or impossible because the UI did not match, or the run going off-script.

Then end with EXACTLY one final line:
FIDELITY: exact   (every step performed as written, against the UI the steps assume)
FIDELITY: partial (mostly followed, with minor divergences)
FIDELITY: diverged (the run did NOT exercise what the steps intended)

Report each occurrence, with WHERE it appears (page/area) and which point in the run it follows (name the preceding screen or action - do NOT give a timestamp):
- broken or missing images / icons / avatars / logos / thumbnails (placeholder or empty image frames)
- text overlapping OTHER elements, or spilling outside its box so it obscures adjacent content, or a fixed non-editable label/heading/button/cell truncated mid-content so meaning is LOST (no ellipsis, no scroll/expand). NOT a long value that simply scrolls inside a text input / textarea / select, NOT text intentionally cut with an ellipsis "...", NOT content inside a scrollable region: a field or box not showing its ENTIRE value is normal, not broken - only flag it when text visibly ESCAPES its box or is cut off with information lost.
- broken or misaligned layout: elements stacked on top of each other, off-screen, wrong z-index (an overlay behind content), components at the wrong size, large unexpected gaps
- content that did not load: blank regions, skeletons / spinners that never resolve, empty lists / tables / grids / maps / charts where data is clearly expected, "no results" / "nothing here" where there should be content
- obvious error or empty states, distorted or unstyled content, default browser styling where the app's own design should be

These are HINTS for a reviewer to verify, NOT final judgments - describe exactly what you see, do not conclude it is a bug. If the app looks visually healthy throughout, reply EXACTLY: "NOTHING OBVIOUSLY WRONG".`;

 * and reports, per validation, whether it VISIBLY occurred - comparing before/after for every expected change.

 */
const MISSION_PROBE_PROMPT = `You are checking whether an automated test achieved its GOAL - the outcomes it set out to verify - NOT whether its steps were merely performed. A step can be carried out while its intended EFFECT never happens: an action that should change what is on screen leaves it unchanged, something that should update does not, a state the app should reach it never reaches. Your job is to catch exactly that.

From the test below, identify each VALIDATION it intends: its stated intent / expected result, plus every assertion or expected STATE CHANGE in its steps. Then watch the ENTIRE recording and, for EACH validation, judge whether it ACTUALLY occurred on screen.

Rules:
- Judge the OUTCOME as a user would experience it: did the result the test is verifying actually happen on screen? A step can be performed while its effect never lands - a control that changes nothing, a value that never updates, a state the app never reaches - and that is exactly what you exist to catch.
- Do not be fooled by a control's own movement: a switch sliding or a button depressing shows it was clicked, not that what it governs changed. Look at the region the action was meant to affect, not the widget.
- Give normal behavior its due: judge the SETTLED result over the whole recording, not one frame. A transient state that resolves on its own (a brief loading/empty flash, a value that hydrates in a beat late) is normal - achieved. An intended change that never happens ANYWHERE in the recording did not occur.
- Judge only what the test actually sets out to verify - do not invent expectations it never had. If the recording genuinely does not let you tell, say UNCLEAR.

For EACH validation, output ONE line:
- ACHIEVED: <validation> - <what you saw that confirms it>
- NOT ACHIEVED: <validation> - <what you saw instead, describing the before-vs-after of the relevant region>
- UNCLEAR: <validation> - <why>

Then end with EXACTLY one final line:
MISSION: achieved   (every validation the test intended actually occurred on screen)
MISSION: partial    (some occurred, some did not)
MISSION: not_achieved (the test's core intended outcome did not occur)

The test follows.`;
